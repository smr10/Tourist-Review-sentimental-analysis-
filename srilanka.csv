There is a decent section of beach but the buildings adjacent to the beach are under attack from fairly big waves and I doubt they will last long because they are not using smart ways to protect the coastline. Putting rocks in front of a...More,2019/04/16,MasafiOne,"Al Ain, United Arab Emirates"

only really downside is the close proximity of the main road.",2019/04/16,ThomasArabia,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates"
My advice... do it in the morning before it gets too hot. There are steps to be climbed and it could be a challenge. Having said that it is really worth it just to be impressed with the human ingenuity that constructed such a temple. The view from the top is impressive. The frescoes that remain on the rock walls are stunning (note no photography allowed). The area is overall impressively maintained right down to the removal of the plastic wrapping from your drink bottle at the checkpoint. Your bags are also checked for any other plastic materials that could contaminate the site. A model other countries could follow. The stair case is quite safe though I can see it can become busy. The signs for hornets is advisory and definitely not an issue for us. Get there when the park opens to avoid the crowds. Certainly worth the climb.,2019/04/16,MelbourneSeeTheWorld,"Galle, Sri Lanka"
"We were very excited to visit .. and more excited about the climb with my 6 year old. but trust me the journey was nice but the destination was not even worth the walk..some tips.. please start the trek latest 8 am in any season.. we started at 10.30 and were exhausted more coz of heat the climb. keep the ticket through the journey, water and some chocolates... there is nothing to buy till you get back on the ground. dont carry food or any thing in hand... keep it safely in bag .. as monkeys are a plenty and they eye every thing...mind the caps and hats as due to wind they can fly off...though climb is nice and adventurous the destination is just ok.. yes view is nice but its just like any other view from hill.. also we climbed it in summer so even the view was very drab... one can skip as this looks like a overhyped placeEntry charges for SAARC- around 2700 INR [ 6000-LKR]. not worth for sure",2019/04/16,Malini P,"Bangalore District, India"
The ancient city was one of our favorite stops on our trip. The climb to the top of the rock is long but worth it. The view is incredible once you reach the top.,2019/04/16,K8errm24,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates"
"What an experience it is to climb the rock. Our driver advised us to do it later in the afternoon to avoid the hottest part of the day but nevertheless, it was still nearly 30° when we climbed around 4pm. That said, it was worth it! It wasn’t as busy as some have said in previous reviews, although there were many people, we didn’t have to wait in long queues going up or down. Just the occasional pause to catch your breath and off you go again while others around you do the same.",2019/04/16,SteveUz,"London, United Kingdom"
"This area is fascinating. The museum gives a great insight into the achievements needed to creat a town on top of this rock thousands of years ago.It is hot and a big walk to the top. Smaller trip to the lions feet is more realistic. While there filming of an Asian version of the amazing race was being filmed, guess one of the choices would have been to run to the top! Was 34 and humid day we were there.Definitely worth a visit just to absorb the size of the area.",2019/04/16,Davbesfoodie,"Bairnsdale, Australia"
"Having spent 2 weeks travelling around Sri Lanka, Ella and Sigiriya had their own charms. Sigirya has alot more wildlife to offer. Many will also argue that 5000 rupees to climb the Lion's Rock is too expensive; which it is. However, if you are coming to Sigiriya then climbing the 2 large rocks is something that just has to be done! There are many steps but it is more straightforward than Pidurangala rock - just be aware that their are monkeys nearer to the top who will want to get into your backpacks!",2019/04/16,Hamsta666,
"We climbed the rock and where not let down, it’s best to have a guide so they can show you things and explain the history. We left our hotel at 6.10am to get to the rock as early as possible ! This was for two reasons to miss the majority of the other tourists and also to do it at the coolest time , I can highly recommend this as it a tough ascent and it gets hot an sweaty. The pain was well worth the it the view was stunning",2019/04/16,Samsam802,"Borehamwood, United Kingdom"
"A steep climb up narrow steps following a steady line of visitors of all ages and ability - so thankful for the metal hand railing. At the top, a cool breeze, the ruins of a 5th-century palace and city, and a panoramic view of the plateau below. Largely the ruins are just foundations, there are a few standing walls. There are no services once you are inside the site so make sure you bring some drinking water; there isnt' any shade and the sun was hot (February). If you are bothered by heights you might find the ascent challenging. Monkeys lounge on the walls, scanning for signs of food, if you bring any food be careful; we saw a lady who was bitten trying to hold onto her snack from a thieving monkey.",2019/04/16,Nancy_Ottawa,"Ottawa, Canada"
"For me, in my opinion, I don’t think it was that great. There’s nothing up there and the way to go was a single track which you have to stucked with a lot of people. I prefer Pidurangala Rock but if you visit Sigiriya, go both rocks!",2019/04/16,Jyblada,"Bangkok, Thailand"
"This is a fortress and ancient city which if you are there in Sigiriya, do visit. Be prepared for a little hike, with lots of stairs to climb, spiralling stairs, steep stairs, tiny stairs etc. But it's worth the walk and a little activity. Don't miss out the heritage site...",2019/04/16,JaniJermans,"Bengaluru, India"
We visited Sigiriya early morning - I think this was a wise choice by our guide due to the heat - Sigiriya is stunning and worth a visit but if you don’t like heights / small staircases on the side of a massive rock then this is not for you. The view from the top is amazing but getting there is hard work - we visited with children aged 6 and 10 and they loved the views but they had plenty of of questions of how / why / when etc and lucky for us the guide had the answers. Well worth the climb but before you head up there is 1200 steps so make sure you have plenty of water as there’s no Starbucks at the top.,2019/04/16,dannyrcollins,essex
"Sigiriya Lion's Rock is one of the best and famous attraction in Sri Lanka. If you are young and fit you should do this activity. It was so fun to Climb, There was so much to learn about history and technology used here. It was rainy day but it was not a big issue for us. It was fun, we enjoyed the rain. It's worth climb to see beautiful view from top of the Sigiriya. AMAZING!",2019/04/16,Srilanka_Travel,"Colombo, Sri Lanka"
"I truly enjoyed climbing Sigiriya Rock. Got there early, and we were on our way at about 6:40 am. It’s hot here in April, so there was some serious sweating involved, but it’s not a huge hike really. Bring some water. Also we had our guide / driver with us who always has all the important stories to explain a place - really a great value add, considering there is just some rubble. I thought the entrance fee for a family of four, in excess of USD 100, quite steep, but I am glad we did it.",2019/04/16,europhile68,"Melbourne, Australia"
"The earlier the better to beat the heat and the crowd. The entrance fee is 5310 rupee for foreigners, which is kind of pricy. It also includes Sigiriya museum that is in the same building of the ticket counter. There are two places for pure drinking water: one at the beginning of the path and the other at the lion rock entrance before getting to the final summit. The view is breathtaking and there are plenty of places to take picturesque photos. Towards the lion paw there are monkeys, so don't be alarmed. Yet it's preferable not to get too close to them as some may snatch something and run. People of different ages were climbing which was admirable. I spent around 3 hours between climbing and resting at the summit. Do not miss the viewpoint which is at the right side of the entrance path. It has an amazing view of the rock.",2019/04/16,Romaica,"Alexandria, Egypt"
"A big respect to my wife, she had fractured her ankle not long before we travelled but she made it to the top. What a climb !!!! If you are contemplating going make sure you go early in the morning otherwise the crowds are enormous, and take a bottle of water. Boots are not needed but trainers will suffice. Take your camera, excellent views from the top. Well worth a visit.",2019/04/16,Vacationer795761,
My daughter and I visited the rock at 630 in the morning. The weather is perfect for walking the rock at this time. I visited the museum and walked in small area before going into the rock area. Not sure you need to buy a $30 ticket to do this. Certainly you have to obtain ticket for the climb.,2019/04/16,747diannep,"London, United Kingdom"
"It's not just a climb up the rock but has an interesting history behind it. The climb it self was exhausting but with the short stops it helped us gain some breath. Once you reach the top, you totally forget the climb the views are just incredible. Would recommend this to everyone with a healthy heart.",2019/04/16,brosie45,United Arab Emirates
"Sigiriya rock is by far the best thing I've seen in Sri Lanka. It has been declared as the 8th wonder of the world by UNESCO and has a rich history associated with it. Tips1. The ticket fare is $30, but if you hold a South Asian Passport you can avail a 50 percent discount. For this however , one must carry the passport, without which there's no way you can avail the discount.2. The ticket counter is open till 5 pm. There are various reasons due to which you may not be able to visit the site, such as bad weather, wasps attack etc. The management however won't refund the ticket and won't allow you to go the next day, even if they disallow your entry. (Which in my opinion is highly unfair)3. Best time to go is after 4. The weather is beautiful and you may witness the sunset",2019/04/16,596nehas,"Pune, India"
"A mix of Ramayana and Buddhism. That would best describe this place. This is one of the places, where Lord Buddha actually visited. This is a world heritage site. The climb is a must to the top and the view is breathtaking. almost every stone has a story and ensure that you have a good guide to appreciate the relevance to Ramayana. The place has some interesting sign boards (see photo attached). Don't let it deter you. It is worth the climb",2019/04/16,scenthill,"chennai, Tamil Nadu, India"
"There are many steps to climb just to get to the Lions Paw the a steep stairs to the top. A good level of fitness is required to get to the top. A Hat sunscreen and plenty of water is essential. The site at the top is surprisingly large. Care needs to be taken because of uneven ground and steps. A very interesting site for those able to get there. Views are wonderful. Watch out for unauthorised guides, There are no facilities once in the site so be prepared.",2019/04/16,Ian M,"Mildura, Australia"
"It’s a must to do whilst in Sri Lanka. We stayed a stone throw away, so saw it each day at breakfast. It was a challenging hike to the top but worth the effort, even though it was hot at the top... it’s advisable to take a hat and wear sun screen. We had an amazing tour guide, so he informed us of the history and information throughout, which was helpful. Watch out for those cheeky monkeys along the way!",2019/04/16,Kittycoocat,

"Horton Plains were an unexpected pleasure. In many ways they reminded of parts of the UK, say Exmoor: moorland with bracken and rhododendron. The standard 9Km circuit is mostly very easy walking though one section is quite a scramble. Sensible shoes are needed. It is popular. The main sights were a little disappointing. But overall it is a very pleasant place",2019/04/16,301lisa33,"Coventry, United Kingdom"

Our hotel packed us a breakfast which we ate after driving but before entering the park. All disposable plastics are confiscated at the entrance apart from water bottles which have their labels removed - so be prepared. The hike itself is definitely challenging in parts around the falls, but the remaining 90% of it is easy to moderate. Our children of 11 & 8 made it around with only an average level of bickering and complaints. We saw a nice sunrise and elk on the way in but no other wildlife after that.",2019/04/16,daddydoma,"Werribee, Australia"

"First Safari we ever experienced and we loved it! We highly recommend that you get a private jeep, we booked through MINDFUL TRAVELS. A private jeep allows you to move around a lot easier, and let's be honest, who doesn't want the whole jeep to themselves?! Make sure to pack yourself a lunch with numerous snacks, especially if you’re doing an all-day safari. There aren’t any places to purchase food & water once you’re inside the park. We did the full day safari and also would recommend doing so because your chances of seeing wildlife increases! We were so lucky to have seen leopards almost immediately after entering the park. We saw so many animals throughout the entire day. Very satisfied with the safari! Remember to always be mindful with the animals! Bring binoculars, extra batteries for your camera, and lots of water!",2019/04/16,yulneveroamalone,"Montreal, Canada"
"Now a safari always has an element of luck but a good knowledgeable guide can help a lot. We went in at the katharagama gate, and I wonder if this area of the Park is quieter than some othersWe saw a range of beautiful birdlife, buffalo, elephants, crocs and a superb leopard sighting. Of course, as with such safaris, there were a number of jeeps with us for much of the time but they (mostly) behaved with consideration for both the wildlife and fellow visitors",2019/04/16,301lisa33,"Coventry, United Kingdom"
I've been in Sri Lanka last February and I have visited Yala National Park.Yala was a kind of race of jeeps with hundreds of smelly jeeps looking for animals that are frightened about all the noise and they are going to hide. That's why I have seen just a few animals and no single elephant. So Yala and tourism is a kind of disaster!!!!,2019/04/16,Anabelle123456,Switzerland

"Yala National Park was an amazing stop on our visit. The wildlife and scenery were incredible. With that, as a tourist you will need to ask your driver to be responsible when you are visiting the park. The drivers are aggressive, and from my observations and experience do not take concern regarding the animals. They are desperate to get as close as possible so the tourist can get their precious shot on instagram. There were times when the elephants displayed stressed behavior towards the vehicles yet the drivers just kept pushing. That was irresponsible and wrong. I am shocked that the park does not have more regulations and monitor this more closely. On our second trip to the park we told our driver we did not want to be around other cars and wanted to respect the animals during our visit. He was amazing and took us to some remote and beautiful locations in the park where we saw lots of comfortable animals enjoying their habitat. If we had not gone the second day I probably would have rated the park 'Poor' because our first day was so bad.",2019/04/16,K8errm24,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates"
"First the caveat - I really enjoyed the trip - seriously did. I knocked the star off because the number of ‘jeeps’ allowed into the park may well be limited but they are all in touch with each other and tend to congregate at the good stuff.There are basically two opportunities to visit Yala. First thing (6am) and in the late afternoon. This is largely because the animals sleep during the heat of the day.We only did the 6am gig and saw lots of elephants, crocodiles, wild pigs and water buffaloes. Plus a wide array of wading birds and a plethora of other birds, enough to make any bird watcher happy - my fave was the spoonbill. So if you want a safari where you see real stuff - tick!The selling point of Yala is the leopards - however our Gide was very cagey about the prospects of seeing one (although the odds seem higher in the evenings as the game comes down to the watering holes).As it happens we did see one! The only problem is the photos I took show that their camouflage is very, very good!All of the jeeps seem pretty much the same. 6 seaters on the back of a pickup truck. Good visibility and open so not too hot. If you are offered anything else, turn it down.The driver we had seemed very knowledgeable and positioned the vehicle in the best aspect for us. His driving was OK until the call came though that a leopard had been sighted - he then drove like a man possessed until he joined the massed ranks of every other vehicle in the park in a huge traffic jam trying to get near to the sleeping leopard in the tree. An hour later we emerged from the scrum feeling a bit miffed in truth.So, do visit Yala. Just be ready for the possibility of traffic chaos...",2019/04/16,AndrewJ990,"Nottingham, United Kingdom"
"It is well worth visiting the national park, although you are just as likely to see as many animals in the areas just outside the national park. We actually saw as many animals just sitting by the pool at our hotel including an elephant something we did not see in the park. As with every safari it is always a matter of luck if you see the more elusive animals. We did not see a leopard or bear but other people did.We went on the Jeep safari first thing, so we were up before it was light, and at the park entrance with roughly another 100 or so jeeps for the 6am opening of the park. Was a convoy to start, but surprisingly the Jeeps dispersed quite quickly across the park, so your jeep was often alone, although you do still come across other jeeps especially if something is spotted, when groups of jeeps can congregate.Personally don’t have a problem with the number of jeeps as they create employment for locals, which in turn makes them interested in looking after the park. Indeed national park has got it right as only part of the park is open to tourists, and most of the park has strict access, meaning animals are free to go to quieter areas if they wish.If I visited again I probably would not have bothered to go first thing, as people who visited later in the day saw more or just as much. It is hotter, but as the jeeps are covered and you get a breeze when the jeep is moving it is ok. You also get the advantage that park is quieter as all the jeeps which came in at 6am have left. 9am or 10am seem ideal.Sadly as is the case worldwide one of the reasons the park exists is because the land is of little value to humans as it is so dry. Shame that we push animals into the more extreme environments rather than allowing them space in the more prime land",2019/04/16,needdm,"Chesterfield, England"

An easy walk with a bit of a climb at the end. Don’t forget to do the zip line. Looked fun. Be adventurous and scramble around to the second peak. The views are worth the treacherous descent and ascent.,2019/04/16,NatalieN586,"Melbourne, Australia"
"Climbing Little Adams peak was one of the activities our tour guide had organised for us whilst in Ella. Setting off early in the morning to avoid the heat we assume, it is a fairly steady walk along for a while, then a climb up some steps to the top. You do not need to be an Olympic athlete to climb this, but a certain level of fitness is required, and the last bit is quite steep; those used to walking and hiking should find it a breeze. The whole climb up and back took approx. 2 hours, but you will definitely work up a sweat doing so ! I would strongly recommend sensible footwear e.g. trainers or walking shoes, and some water !On the way up we passed some tea pickers in the fields next to the path, who were more than happy to pose for some pictures, for a small reward / LKR tip of course !Once at the top there is another good photo opportunity stood next to the small statue / shrine, and then some absolutely stunning views over the surrounding countryside and the valley below. There is a large rock ledge where everyone takes their turn to stand on or dangle their legs over the edge and take photos.On the way back down we passed the tea pickers again, who were now having some food - probably lunch since they start so early in the morning ? There was also a little coconut / drinks shack hut that had opened up on the way down, where you can buy a well deserved cold drink to cool down with.A very enjoyable way to see more of the great beauty of Sri Lanka.",2019/04/16,Colin S,"Yorkshire, United Kingdom"
"This is a short hike that isn’t challenging. It doesn’t take long, but provides incredible views. It took us 1.5 hours round trip and that included time for a couple hundred photos - yes, it’s that stunning! Go early (before 9AM) to avoid large crowds. It gets hot, so take water from the main town before you go. Sometimes there’s a man selling ice cold water - literally a massive chunk of ice in the bottle - close to the top for 120 LKR. If you see him, buy the water. It’s the coldest and most satisfying water you’ll get in Sri Lanka!!",2019/04/16,majorje,"Bedford, Canada"

"There are two small puppies and a few dogs who apparently live on the very peak and all they eat is snacks shared by tourists.

Please take food and feed them in separate areas away from each other as best as you can. They're starving and desperate, so quick to fight with each other. The more vicious mother has puppies right at the top near the shrine, so make sure not to feed the others near her puppies.There is a silver water bowl so bring spare water up, if it's not around then it might be on the path to the other plateau. They're very submissive towards humans, but there's a vicious pecking order between them.",2019/04/16,WorktoTravel2,"Orillia, Canada"
"Fairly easy climb up Little Adams Peak - would recommend going up early morning to beat the heat!

"Little Adam’s Peak is a fairly easy hike found in Ella, Sri Lanka and is a short 20-minute walk from the center of town. Also, it’s completely FREE! The entrance is easily located on Google maps, but just in case, you can find the entrance between The Chillout Ella and the Ella Flower Garden Resort. The hike starts with a very slow ascent through a dirt path surrounded by tea fields and stunning views of the lush green valleys that shroud hill country. You’ll make your way along said path for about 15-minutes depending on your walking speed where you’ll see the staircase that leads all the way to the peak; you literally cannot miss it! The best time to climb Little Adam’s Peak would be sunrise. There aren’t many early risers, therefore you will beat the crowds if you go for sunrise. Little Adam’s Peak has a great effort to view ratio which is why tourists flock here all year round to catch glimpses of the beautiful tea country laid out below.",2019/04/16,yulneveroamalone,"Montreal, Canada"

"Little Adams Peak is great if you want to go for a short hike. There are two ways to reach the steps up Little Adams Peak. You can enter at the zip line entrance or you can continue further along the road beyond the turn off for Nine Arch Bridge. We entered beyond the turn off for Nine Arch Bridge which means less of a climb up as you’re starting higher up. We then left via the other exit which brought us out closer to Ella. As well as the main Peak you can also continue further down a steep slope (with steps sort of cut into the clay bank) and up another slope to a second peak. Both peaks give excellent views of the area. If you are going to go to the second Peak it’s worthwhile taking shoes, not jandals or flip flops.",2019/04/16,Meagantravels,Christchurch

"Tragically on Mon 15 Apr at 2:40pm there was a drowning incident at this beach. The waves were extremely strong, further compromising the normal conditions which feature a strong tidal rip.Assisting with the rescue were two doctors, a nurse, a paramedic and a firefighter. All foreigners. It took ten minutes for local lifesavers to arrive on scene even though they were less than 200m down the beach. Once there the lifesavers stood back and observed without relieving tiring people whom were performing CPR or offering any direction or reassurance that further assistance was on the way. The CPR balloon and defibrillator on site did not function. After we loaded the individual in the ambulance it took a further three minutes for the driver to turn the vehicle around and get it moving towards the hospital.After the ambulance had departed witnesses sought out lifeguards to give a statement; they seemed surprised at this and there was no template for an incident report or recording our details. During discussion one of the lifeguards indicated “today was a bad day to go in the water” but shrugged when asked why people were not being discouraged. I would strongly caution against young children or inexperienced swimmers entering the water here. I hope the individual and his family are okay and I offer my thanks and respect to those people that did what they could to assist.",2019/04/16,daddydoma,"Werribee, Australia"
Mirissa Beach is beautiful. We love swimming in the ocean and this place did not disappoint. The water was crystal clear and warm. There was a few big waves which may be challenging for inexperienced swimmers but I would recommend they swim in the patrolled section in the middle of the beach.The southern end of the beach near Parrot Rock is great for snorkelling as well as a shallow pool for little kids to swim. There are plenty of bars and restaurants along the stretch of the beach if you would like a bite to eat or something to drink.,2019/04/16,mrandmrsbeas,"Sydney, Australia"
"Probably the best beach in the area to chill on as there’s lots of bars and restaurants where you can either pay for beds or get a drink and chill on the beds. Also shaded area next to the lifeguard hut. Towards the end of the beach as if you are walking the direction to welligama (west) there is a man selling beautiful clothes for very cheap. So cheap it’s not even worth haggling with him. 400 for shorts, 500-700 for dresses, trousers and jump suits. Also little purses and bunting made out of Sri Lankan/Indian material. Very kind man lets you try clothes on and has a mirror. When I was there there was a group of girls trying to haggle the price down but it seemed so silly as they’re SO cheap anyway. He has a factory in Weligama where he makes the clothes so is able to sell at bottom prices.Overall nice beach to chill out on during the day and eat/drink at night.",2019/04/16,snowgirl3,"Bangkok, Thailand"

"Not only is it cooler in the evening, there is a ceremony that makes the experinece more interesting. From our hotel, we walked around Kandy Lake, dodging duck poop and giant water monitors to the Temple of the Tooth Relic for the evening ceremony. Legend has it that a tooth of the Buddha was retrieved from his funeral pyre and finally laid to rest in Kandy after being saved from invaders in Anuradhapura (first ancient capital) and then Polonnaruwa (second ancient capital). The tooth is held in an elaborate gold casket inside a chamber, inside the temple and is guarded by monks. To see this you must queue, up the staircase and along the walls and at auspicious times during the drums and flutes, you are ushered single file past and allowed a millisecond look through an opening into the chamber with giant elephant tusks and gold everywhere.

"The Temple of the Sacred Tooth is obviously a very religious and sacred place for Buddhists and it was good to see there were many people other than tourists who were offering their prayers.There are lots of good photo opportunities and anyone with an interest in temples or Bhuddism will probably consider this a must visit.We did not experience any of the hassle or 'scammers' that other reviewers have mentioned, however this might be because we were already in our own tour guide group. Nor did we find it overly busy or crowded, so maybe we visited at the right time of year or day ?Just bear in mind that this seems to be the most popular thing to visit in Kandy and as a result of course it is going to be busy and 'touristy'. In this respect it is just like any other tourist attraction.I am surprised that some people have mentioned spending just 30 minutes here; as well as the temple itself, there are also some large grounds to explore. We had approximately 2 hours, and could easily have spent a little while longer.As a side note : if you really don't do crowds well, or have limited time in Kandy, you might want to consider the Royal Botanical Gardens as an alternative; this is located out of Kandy centre and is a green oasis of tranquillity. See my other reviews for more information .... !",2019/04/16,Colin S,"Yorkshire, United Kingdom"

"I am a tourist currently staying in Sri Lanka, Colombo. Yesterday, I visited Gangaramaya buddhist temple. It is indeed a beautiful place with an amazing history behind it. Nonetheless its glory is greatly undermined as in the parking just opposite the temple, on a small patch of land, people keep an elephant that is chained. I can't understand what could possibly be the reason of keeping such a great wild animal in the middle of Colombo, chained and without space to move, and as much as I respect the buddhist culture and its traditions, I really feel the call to do something about this. Apparently the elephant has been chained there for 20 years! I can't even imagine this in the 21st century when we know how precious are these animals, and Sri Lanka has so many elephant orphanages. Apparently again, as people at the temple did not want to talk to me about the elephant as if it was some kind of a secret, they use the elephant for sacred services at the temple. The temple itself is full of animal relics, such as tusks, ivory statues, elephant legs, head and even a tail. There is also a huge stuffed elephant called Raja, which had its tusks growing in a peculiar way and was considered sacred. Is this the way to protect these majestic animals of Sri Lanka? Surely not. Please help me take actions and change its life.",2019/04/16,Marta M,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia"

"I highly recommend bringing the exact amount of money you need to enter. The price is $35/person, and I dont recommend paying in their local currency as it fluctuates too much from day to day. The line to purchase the tickets also gets really long, so you should get there as early as possible. Place opens up at 6am on most days. About 1h30 to 2h going up pending the flow of people.This is definitely a must do while in Sri Lanka as there's so much history behind the whole place.

We climbed it yesterday: went OK.What has surprised me enormous is the fact that the changed opening times (06.30 instead of 07.00) are nowhere to find on the many websites about Sigiriya!This change is from 15 Februar 2019 and SIGIRIYA PROJECTS CENTRAL CULTURAL FUND didn’t make any effort in publishing this important change on his/her websites!What a shame!Within every minute it gets warmer so there are quite a number of tourists wanting to start the climb as early as possible. Half an hour earlier is important news!Shame on all people committed to Sigiriya!Another remark is the sad lack of maintainance of the architectonal beautiful building of the Sigiriya Museum.‘They’ don’t care how neglected that building looks...

This place is hugely significant to local culture. Like all temples a dress code is (strictly) enforced. It is really busy at the very limited times of day when the tooth's casket is displayed.

"We left our Sigiriya hotel early to take advantage of the cooler conditions, we drove half an hour to Sigiriya Rock Fortress, a UNESCO site that dates back to the 5th Century when established as a king's palace and fortress. It was later used as a Buddhist Monastery until the 14th Century. I climbed this Fortress also known as Lion Rock some 1250 steps up to the top and then another 1250 back down. It was great personal achievement to complete the climb. The views and just walking around the former fortress and temple site, marveling at their achievements back in 5th Century was very worthwhile. Several likened the climb to Ankor Watt in Cambodia. A few of us who had walked to World's End a few days prior thought the first stage of that walk was more demanding than all those Lion Rock steps. Both required a very good fitness level.",2019/04/08,David W,"Ballarat, Australia"

It looks incredibly daunting from the bottom, but it takes much less time to climb than you'd think, and when you get to the top the views are amazing and the ruins are well worth taking time to admireWe ate our packed breakfast at the top, and if you do that keep an eye out for monkeys.Take plenty of water.

"Climbing the rock of Sigiriya is an essential part of a visit to Sri Lanka and possibly the most memorable. It can be crowded and hot but experiencing the climb together with the thousands of Sri Lankan people is not to be missed. Get there early and take plenty of water. A back pack is a good idea to leave hands free as some of the climb is quite steep and exposed, although always robust and safe. There are a lot of steps but it is always crowded so the rate of climb is leisurely and does not feel strenuous for the older person. The climb itself is exciting and breathtaking, but there is also the most stunning cave art after a short stretch up a spiral staircase, and then the view from the top is marvellous.",2019/04/08,davidhF6845GY,"Bury St Edmunds, England, United Kingdom"

The climb is just over 1000 steps so you need to be fit and not suffer from vertigo. There are fabulous views and a stopping place two-thirds of the way up if you cannot make it to the top.

"Attended a full day safari which was booked for us as part of a tour with Asya tours who we thoroughly recommend if you want any excursions arranged for you at a reasonable price. Our safari started at 5am when we left our hotel to arrive at the park. On the journey to the park we saw safari jeeps collecting tourists the whole way. When we arrived there were a huge amount of jeeps waiting for the gates to open. Then when they open you are in a traffic jam waiting to get in. Not as rustic as I’d hoped! We entered the park at 6am and 6:15 we saw the beautiful spotted leopard. However, we were extremely lucky to see it and our house and driver hadn’t seen one for weeks! We saw many birds, crocodiles, elephants, buffalo etc. I wouldn’t recommend a full day. All cars have to sit down by the beach between 12 and 2 then you leave for your afternoon drive. We didn’t see anything new in the afternoon and the temperature was so hot we would have preferred to head back. PLEASE NOTE... Just as our guide was about to leave he announced to us that he is a volunteer and waited for payment. This was a shock to us as with our tour we had paid for the safari and the driver so thought we had paid him already but no! We paid 1000 LKR as that was all we had on us.

As we discovered, luckily, you don't have to go all the way up but at least get yourself up to the rock paintings and lions feet.

"Incredible and absolutely worth the cost- as foreigners we should definitely pay more so I do not disagree with this.All the reviews tell you what to expect. My review is a message to all you super unfit folks like me- it’s totally doable!Several tips if like me- you haven’t exercised for over 15 years, your doctor says your obese, your nickname is ‘baby elephant’, and you have a dodgy knee or ankle- Go early if you can’t cope in heat. We started our walk about 8am but spent so long enjoying the beautiful gardens that we probably didn’t start climbing until 9am. And we reached the top 59mins later- including many breaks on the way up. Before 12 is good because the rock itself provides shade as you go up. Take 2 litres of water with you if you can manage. I drank 1.5 litres up and down that day. -If you don’t like the pressure of fast people behind you then actually it’s better to go when it’s busy- and it’s pretty busy in the morning! This is because it’s starts to get into a slow single file pace- so you can only move as fast as the crowd. I loved the busy bits as I got a chance to breathe!- Lots of staircase corners for you to take breaks on. If people don’t like it - ignore them. They are skinny enough to squeeze round you.- If you can’t manage the narrow windy staircase to see the frescos then just don’t do it- there is a sneaky underpass which detours from the stairs. However I did do it because it was incredible - and I survived - The top is awesome! Before you reach the summit - you can take a break once you reach the area where the lions feet are. Catch your breath fully- I stopped for 10 mins or so. Then just go for a final push on the stairs to the top! Eye of the tiger style. Or just get behind a massive tour group who will set a slow pace.- Going down hurts the knees more than going up hurts your lungs. Take you time going down. Going sideways can sometimes help. - Once you get to the end- the last battle is getting through the peddlers. Bear in mind this is their job so no need to be rude. Instead admire the selling tactics and if your genuinely not interested then keep on walking. The good thing about being unfit is you will have little breath left in you by this point so all you can manage is a polite flap of your hand to say no thanks, or yes yes please, I will pay anything for that ice cool bottle of waterIn summary, if a mum carrying a newborn in her arms and no shoes can do it- then so can you :)",2019/04/05,thunderdwarf,
"The best advice I can give is to get up early and be at the ticket office when it opens at 6.30amBefore the crowds arrive. Climb straight to the top, you can do the grounds and the museum afterwards. By 9am the place starts to get busy and coaches arrive. I can’t imagine the climb is much fun when it’s very hot and there are queues to ascend the rock. It’s a 20-30 minute climb up stone stairs, then spiral metal stairs and walkways attaches to the rock. It’s hair raising at times but the views and ruins are worth it. So is the entrance fee as the whole site is well staffed and maintained. Enjoy!",2019/04/05,English_Ali,"London, United Kingdom"

Galle fort was extremely interesting to visit and I enjoyed my day there.One scam to watch for is people selling old coins purported to come from ship wrecks.It is against the law in Sri Lanka to remove artifacts from wrecks that are 100 years or more old.

Firstly, as a foreigner, we need to pay much more than the local, $30, which is quite a bit money to the local. It was a bit expensive to us, but we still pay and looking forward to seeing the most famous place of Sri Lanka. As soon as we started walking to the entrance, there were so many local private guides trying to approach you and presvating you do to do a tour with them. They were insanely annoying!!!! After you rejecting one, there would be another one coming to you and ask you again!!! They do this even inside the site !!! I don't know how could the management of the site allows these people getting inside of the site and let them do things like this !!! And there was one guy following us for about 5 mins, we kept saying no to him and finally he was gone but scrolling to us !!! What the hell!!! This has completely ruined my whole day !!! Then after going to the top of the rock, the view there was very beautiful and no annoying people there, we were happy about this. But on our way back, there was another guy, he was saying to show us a shortcut to the exit, we saw him was wearing a ID card and said he works there so we trusted him and thought we finally met a nice person. But after him showing us to the shortcut, he asked us for money !!! $20!!! What the hell !!! We kept saying that we had no money but he was super annoying and at the end we paid him 200 rupees for our freedom!!! The management of site is such a joke!!!

The slower queue offers you a better and less frantic view. We didn't wait in the slow queue but could see why people did. In the quicker queue, it was more of a free for all and a view from approx. 10 metres. You can only see the Tooth Relic during ceremony times.

"I climbed this rock with my two children ages 8 and 4. I was really concerned about the safety. Oh well, the climb is not unsafe at all. All the 1200 steps are well made. Few are bricked and others are metal stairs. They’re fenced as you go up. There are many places in between with shade where you can stop and rest. Its hot no doubt. Carry water and wear sunscreen and hats. Its gets windy as you go up so no worries. You’ll pass through a little cave with paintings 1600 years ago beautifully preserved. No pictures allowed here. Then a mirror wall (which reflects no more) due to wear and tear over time.I took a guide with me. Took 2000 sri lankan rupees. You might not need one if you just google about the place before you visit. Its an expensive sightseeing but kinda worth. The views from the top are nice, but since its open and hot you might not end up staying up for long. Pat youself once you climb the beast!",2019/04/03,Ahsanasra,
"Very impressive, but go as early as possible as it is very exposed and hot. We got there at 6.30 when it opens and there were a reasonable number of people there even then. When we were on the top at 8am it was very hot and obviously would be much warmer later in the day. There is little shade on the top.The other advantage of getting there early is the crowds are less. I would not fancy going up the final very exposed climb when it was crowded. It is bad enough going up when it isn’t and anybody with vertigo might be sensible to avoid the climb. I did it by concentrating on the steps rather than looking at the sheer drop to the side of you as you go up a steep steel staircase bolted to the rock.The rock art is also impressive although to reach it you have to go up a spiral staircase halfway up the rock. Perfectly safe, but you don’t feel it",2019/04/03,needdm,"Chesterfield, England"

"Among the attractions in Sri Lanka, Little Adam's Peak impressed me most with her natural rustic setting, breathtaking mountainous scenery and memorable hike. I was born and brought up in a metropolis city bombarded with irritating noise from the zooming vehicles and factory machineries; the atmosphere pervaded with toxic pollutants from the car exhausts and industrial chimneys. But here in Ella and the Little Adam's Peak, the setting was so different with lush greenery everywhere and very far from the madding crowd. As I slowly wandered among the lush greenery, the lyrics of the Happy Wanderer resonates in my ear:I like to go a wandering up the mountain track. And as I go, I love to singMy knapsack on my back. Val-deri, val-dera. Val-deri, val-deraHa, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha Ha Val-dera. My knapsack on my backAnother thing wonderful about Ella is that the nearby attractions, be it this Little Adam's Peak, the Nine Arch Bridge, the waterfall are all within walking distance from the train station and near the town center. The hike to Little Adam's Peak was comfortably done without I even realized that I was at the summit of the mountain. It was something slightly more difficult than climbing Bukit Timah Hill in Singapore. Early morning at about 6.30 am, I strolled my way from my hostel to the town center. The road to the Little Adam's Peak is on the left turn from the town center. I had my simple breakfast of a plate of two pieces of coconut roti with a cup of Ceylonese tea in one of the restaurants along the road to the scenic attraction. There was a morning bazaar on the street just at the junction of the town center and the adjoining road to the Little Adam's Peak. I enjoyed seeing the locals in their daily morning routine. It took me about half an hour to arrive at the base of the Little Adam's Peak. The lush greenery of the tea plantations that followed and the rustic setting of the village and the hillside track really uplifted my hiking spirit. The magnificent looming Ella Rock mountain appeared robustly gorgeous and was a beautiful sight as we hike up the track to the summit. It was a uphill laborious climb though it was not that high. I was panting heavily as the steps were steep but the moment I reached the summit, the panoramic mountainous view was spectacularly impressive and gorgeous. Breathtaking views and a rustic scenery. The air is fresh, the environment calm and peaceful and the scenery beautiful. It is waste if you miss this when you are in Ella.",2019/04/02,ah tee s,"Singapore, Singapore"

We have never had this problem at any other sight in Sri Lanka, and were pretty upset about it, as it was a difference of 4000 rs! Second, there is absolutely nowhere to by water once you enter.

"This was our 4 th Safari tour since 2014. Beautiful Yala national park - nearly everything is still the same! Same procedures as last time, - again, only my wife and me back in a car. A huge number of safari cars and drivers around us - the same check in into the park, the same very bumpy sand- and mud roads. Suddenly; - one man missing!? :) - until last time 2017, all safari tours have been ""guidet""! normally by a young park ranger - there was a lot of them - very friendly, very proud to tell us about the animals in the park - and the most important fact, they pointed out nearly all the animals for us a long time before we cut see them!! Next time we have to ask for ""a guidet tour"" and we will pay for it, extra!Now to the heading/title - the animals are still there, and this is very ok :) - but now there are nearly twice so much safari cars as years before! Therefor, why not a new regulation with ""only /at least 6 persons""! on a car!!? - hereby ca 50 % off the cars are finished !Today, normally you have to drive some miles in a row of cars before approaching the gate to the park - and you start/continue your safari with this row all the 3 hours trough the park. This isn't the main problem - because everybody has his eyes on the landscape around and looking for/ or watching animals! The new problem is, and it's for my for the first time!! - it's to much exhaust, this terrible smell of all the exhaust from all this cars engines !! - and there are a lot of old cars with old engines; - you can't see many new cars - and I guess the most of this old cars are somehow ""fixed"" by the driver or company - as a ""home made service""?I think something has to be done in the near future with all this safari cars.Further on I will mansion the passengers security back on this cars - I couldn't see no car or singel tourist with safety belts on! There are no propper steps up to the deck - you have to climb like a monkey - not good for older peoples like us. There is not good enough communication with only a driver ( no guide anymore!?) - the driver has to concentrate his view on this bumpy roads, and of course looking for animals. No time to look after his peoples on the back deck. Why you don't give us a headphone with mic?Have this cars proper services and inspections by the authorities? - for this very special cars it should be at least once a season!? Why not have a car inspector beside the park entrance, just looking after the technical conditions of all this cars, make belt controls and especelly don't except ""a lot of exhaust smoke"". In the long run the animals will suffer under this circumstances, too.At last one more question: What about electric vehicles/ safari cars in the future??Good luck, Yala - a lot can be done for a much better experience for all, in the future. :)",2019/03/31,Axel S,"Lillehammer, Norway"
"We went quite early in the morning to avoid the extreme heat and glad we did as there is little or no shade on both sides of the peak......but what views simply stunning, lush green mountainside and tea plantations everywhere you look.The basic walk up is the peak is a lot of steep steps in parts, but not a hard climb. If you try to walk from the side where you arrive by the two small Bhuddas to the other side, it looks ok at first, then it gets a little bit rocky in parts, you are almost scrambling rocks on a few occasions, and some people were finding it harder coming back down as the gravel made the steep parts a bit uneasy underfoot. All that said it’s definitely worth it when you get there.",2019/03/31,GSPWOLVES,"Wolverhampton, United Kingdom"

"A bit weird: first remove your shoes on the left, then buy a ticket on the right in a machine that does not give change or accept cardsThe rest is really fantastic! By entering you start to feel the great atmosphere of the place (unless you go at a time when all tourists gather to see the process when it´s completely crowded and cannot move). So, plan to visit another time if you want to see the temple quietly and nicely and then go again for the process in the evening. The tooth relic is only shown during the process, but you can see the closed golden altar all the time. I recommend to feel the spirit of the place, walk around, explore the gardens as well (1hr at the least).",2019/03/31,barnieh,"Bratislava, Slovakia"
When my guide first took me there I couldn't believe this. This much charming peaceful temple in the middle of a rushed city. It was a old temple with a quite a history. also it has a museum. I saw some of very old printing machines in the museum which was quite interesting. you need to buy a ticket to enter the place. there were young local couple who came to worship. They were kind enough to share flowers with me and taught me how to do the rituals for Lord Buddha. had a nice evening thanks to my guide - Roshan.,2019/03/31,adamcarnish,"Western Ireland, Ireland"

"We first stopped for a short time on a tour, but saw that it had a lot to offer so when we had a free day in Columbo we took the two hour train ride to Hikaduwa. (Don't get suckered in to first class like we did, go second. See my other review) the streets are full of shops, bars, restaurants and some street food. We felt adventurous, so got some bbq fish and chicken from a stall at the beach car park. Wow! It's local, authentic, which means the fish is roughly chopped bbq'd sauced and spiced, as is the chicken and served in a cardboard dish. Lots of meat on the fish. Beautiful. Ask for spicy otherwise it will be mild. On to the beach. All manner of water sports on offer; scuba, snorkelling, glass bottom boat, surfing hire, lessons. We just swam and snorkelled in the warm water. At the southern end of the beach large sea turtles are found while wading in the shallow reef. Not sure why they stay there, they don't seem distressed at all the people's attention. Beautiful to watch up close. Lots of coconut vendors and beachfront restaurants. We had lunch at ""Parrots paradise"" (see other review). Don't forget to have them open the nut after drinking to scrape the flesh.. yum. We also bought a small bottle of calypso white rum from a bottle shop, well worth it to top up the coconut. Beach gets really hot in the middle of the day with not much shade around, so maybe a cafe, restaurant or bar. Morning, terrific. Great day was had.",2019/03/30,Conpat05,"George Town, Australia"

Sorry review is late ! 1-2/7/18Yala National Park. Kulu safaris. Travelled to Yala National Park from Galle on a very big coach (24 of us) We were staying in tented accommodation- Kulu safari camp. We all picked up in open jeeps by the camp staff for the final leg of the journey. All guests are picked up and transported in the safari camp jeeps. Once there we were all allocated our tents. Kulu has a mixed size of tents but more importantly some are NOT AC. these also did not have any running water that is washing and brushing teeth was using a bowl Of water. The shower was an outside shower which had a tank Overhead. For our family this was a problem. Partly we did not expect this type of accommodation and partly because most of the party had AC tents. We concluded that the non AC tents should not be part of the Kulu safari accommodation. It lets the company down!!!! On the other hand the AC tents were luxurious. But one must remember they are tents in a jungle and rooms are bound to have some creepy crawlers. The jeep safaris were good however best not to compare a leopard safari to East African safaris where one sees the big five on most drives. The leopard is a shy animal. We did see one almost on all our (4) excursions but often far away. The park should have rangers better organised. Once a leopard is spotted it’s mayhem with jeeps sometimes 15-20 all trying to get into a small area for the viewing. With Kulu they have naturalist to accompany each jeep. They were a wealth of information. There are various activities. There is a walk one can do at the camp - it’s moderate intensity walk up a hillock. The views are amazing at the top. There is kayaking too In he lake. The climb up the tree house is worth it at both sunrise and sunset. The food and hospitality was very good. We did request the breakfast dhal recipe which was sublime. The staff are very friendly and keen to help. It’s very hot and humid and especially after a dusty safari - a cold face towel is welcome. We made the suggestion and it was immediately implemented. Thank you for making us all feel very welcome. Thank you also for baking the huge cake for my cousins wedding anniversary.

This is certainly an impressive setting. So impressive that it sure brings in the crowds. Being declared a heritage site by UNESCO guarantees you will be slugged a $US30 admission fee. You are warned by a small notice at the ticket counter that if there is too much crowd congestion on site you may not be admitted. In that case you will not be refunded the ticket price! Similarly if access to the site is terminated by a swarm of wasps from one of the many nests in the area you will also receive no refund. Climbing the rock in the high heat is a bit of a chore but it is likely your climb will be slowed by queues of tourists especially at many of the pinchpoints on the stairway.

A tour guide spring himself on us and we assumed it was included in the ticket price (15000 rupees), however at the end of a very short and quick tour of the temple he demanded 2000 rupees from us.Although it is a lovely sight to see and was high on my list, I feel that it was a overpriced and not suite with the money.",2019/03/27,924meaganh,
Temple was good.  Not as grand as other Buddhist temple I’ve toured. You can only see the relic (tooth) at either 6:30 am or 6:30 pm. It’s locked behind a door all other times,2019/03/27,851lennyl,"Douglasville, Georgia"

This hike up the hill made a lot of people pant and sweat - make sure you attempt this early in the morning when it is cool. On the way up you can take a trip on the zip line for some thrills.

"Little Adams Peak is a great short trail walk that is very well sign posted and easy to get to. The walk up and down is approximately 40 minutes return however I would allow at least 30 minutes at the top because the view is spectacular (sunrise and sunset are best). Most of the walk is flat however the last 10 minutes up is steep with a lot of stairs. I would recommend wearing enclosed shoes. There are approximately 10 dogs that live at the top of the peak, 5 of which are very small puppies. There is a water bowl at the top for them, so I highly recommend taking a water bottle to fill up their bowl for them. We also purchased some Pedigree dog biscuits from Ella Gap Supermarket in town which all the dogs at the top loved. They are reliant on humans for food and water due to living up there. All of the dogs are friendly and it’s definitely a must do walk to the top of you’re visiting Ella!",2019/03/26,ZaylaT,"Perth, Australia"

Continued to speed and drive dangerously the whole day. Our 4 passengers were concerned with safety, no seatbelts, driving in ditches almost on 2 wheels at times, we as passengers in fear of rolling the vehicle. We were lucky to see most of the animals we hoped including a leopard. Driver lost interest once we had seen animals and took us back to hotel 1.5 hours early.

"Myself and my husband completed this today, neither of us would consider ourselves hikers and found this climb ok. The first half is easy and mostly flat. Some amazing photo opportunities. Bare in mind tea pickers offer you a photo and then ask for money. The 2nd half is concrete steps inconsistent in size and some natural pathways. This part was slightly more challenging but no one rushes you so take your time and catch your breath and it should be ok for able bodied people with an average fitness level. The views when you reach the top are breathtaking. Completely worth the hundreds of steps. Absolutely stunning. We left our hotel in Ella by foot about 8.30am to avoid the hot sun. It took about 1.5 hrs to get to the top, chill and take pics and then get back down. Bring plenty of water with you. We also teamed this walk with a walk ro 9 arch bridge as it's close by.My highlight of Ella for sure",2019/03/25,fiona_88_marie,"Belfast, United Kingdom"
This museum deserves better. The priceless exhibits deserve better lighting and conditions for those visiting. A few floor fans aimed at attendants is understandable but to the visitor is typically unable to concentrate on exhibits in comfort and so move on without gaining a full appreciation of the displays.

Really love it here. We have been to many temples but nothing like this. The fact they have a museum here and boards that tell you all about the history and belief is what make this a MUST SEE in Kandy. We went on Sunday and really enjoyed the ceremony they had.

So try not to visit during school breaks, otherwise you would not able to enjoy the most out of the site. Entrance fee is LKR1500 for foreigners. The building is beautiful with unique carvings, some part are made or plated with gold and the paintings/pattern on the wall are fascinating.

"We visited here quite a number of times during our week long stay In Hikkaduwa. Whilst is very beautiful, there is a VERY strong current so beware if you are planning a swim in the water. There were lots of people in the water but it frightened me and I never went out of my depth. There were quite a few surfers and lots of places where you could hire snorkels, a boat trip, scuba lessons, etc. There were also a lot of people selling coconuts, pineapples and items of clothing. If you show the slightest interest in the clothing the ladies are very difficult to say no to if you don’t agree on a price. I witnessed this with a chap who wasn’t happy with the price and the lady was very dogged in her attempt to make a sale. If you say no straight away, they leave you alone. There are a lot of fish very close to the waters edge and some locals feed them and you can see them almost jumping out of the water to get the food. We also saw a turtle very close to the beach and lots of tourists crowding around it and touching it - please do not touch them if you are lucky enough to see one yourselves. On a downside, there is a lot of litter around the beach and around Hikkaduwa in general.",2019/03/24,MimsandNin,"Nottingham, United Kingdom"
"Located about 2 hours from Trincomalee, Sri Lanka is the ancient village of Siririya. Overlooking the village is the unique landscape Sigiriya Rock had a palace on top built in the 5th century AD. The Rock is a 200 meter out cropping entered by walking through pathways and magnificent gardens, pools, terraces, and the remnants of buildings. Mid-way up the Rock you arrive at a sectioned off part, just after the Mirror Wall, that includes 19 female fresco figures which date from the 5th century. The government has banned any photography of the figures in order to preserve their coloration. Access to the Mirror Wall, paintings, Lion's Paw and to the top of the rock is a challenge. Many of the rock stairs are uneven and do not include handrails. You need to be physically fit to make the climb to the top but if you are physically challenged you can take a break part way up where there are about three flat break areas and shade. Expect to take about 90 minutes of climbing to arrive at the top of the Rock from the base. The route up to the top is a combination of rock steps, metal stairs, and a few flat areas.The 360 degree view at the top is definitely worth the climb with access to the building foundations, a pool, and pathways. This is a great adventure but if it is hot and humid make sure you take a bottle of water with you. Best to go early in the morning when the climb is less crowded and it is cooler.",2019/03/24,BobWE,"Manhattan Beach, CA"

No wheelchair access. Most of the walk is comfortable.The last 10-20 minutes are stairs. The stairs are quite small in some parts making it a slight irritation to climb.Be careful with children on the peak. The best time to do it is early morning as there is no haze before 8 am making amazing photo's. The views are mind blowing worth every step.When taking photos of the ladies picking tea they require 100 rupees donation. One can buy water on the to the peak.,2019/03/24,Meleasy,

There is a special ceremony that we witnessed that was accompanied by metallic gongs and drums. This event was packed with people on the first and second floors--not good for anyone who suffers from agoraphobia as it was very crowded.

This was around a four hour drive and we also visited the Pidurangala Rock and Dambulla Temple on this day.We paid 5400 rupees each to enter the Sigiriya Rock Site and it took us around two hours to reach the summit. This was mostly because of the queues on the stairs so this could change at different times of the day. We arrived at 09:30. It was a relatively easy walk and the delays on the stairs enabled some good rest stops. It was a really enjoyable morning. The rock has plenty of photo opportunities and the site itself has other places of interest to visit along the way. The views were spectacular and there are opportunities to see monkeys. There were warning signs about hornet nests which are situated on the rock but luckily no such swarms ended our walk prematurely. A must-see for all tourists!,2019/03/21,CroxleyJD,"Croxley Green, United Kingdom"
"We visited Lion Rock in early March. Without doubt it was one of the top things I did while in Sri Lanka. The only criticism I have is the cost. It is an extortionate amount to visit a location anywhere, let alone Sri Lanka... luckily there were only two of us. Despite the cost, i would strongly recommend visiting. You cannot visit Sri Lanka and not go here!!We skipped the museum as we had done a lot of reading prior to our visit so I am unable to comment on this, but the grounds themselves were incredible. Well worth a casual stroll before climbing the rock. We went around 10am in an attempt to avoid the high temperatures... didn’t happen. You get the sun and heat from every angle. I also suggest taking lots of water with you. The heat and the climb takes it out of you and there is nowhere to purchase water from. In addition, there is no hiding/getting out of the sun when at the top. The climb itself isn’t too taxing and you reach the top a lot sooner than you expect... but it will not disappoint. The ruins themselves and the views cannot he matched!! How anyone managed to climb to the top in the 14th century is beyond me.... let alone carry supplies and building materials. Very impressive.At the exit car park there are shops to rehydrate",2019/03/21,O3834UFdanielw,"London, United Kingdom"
"A very interesting ancient rocky location to visit with beautiful gardens. Difficult climb (1202 stairs) that may take an hour. Better not to take kids and to keep rehydrated.

"We like hiking and Little Adam Peak is a good ‘short’ hike. For the first 3/4 it’s fairly easy going, but the stairs at the end are a little tough. The views from the top are worth the effort, however. We started around 0930 which is about as late as I would have wanted to start as it was fairly hot by the time we got to the top. It’s a pleasant walk though tea plantations and there are tea pickers toiling away as they must do day after day to make their daily quota of 20kgs. There is also a zip line at about the half way point, so take take to reduce the full walk back down.",2019/03/21,andyffnz,"Auckland, New Zealand"
"We opted to begin our walk at 8am as we didn’t want to walk in the dark. It wasn’t too hot when we reached the top.The route for the walk is very clear once you reach the flower garden hotel on the road. The path is mainly concrete steps once you reach the incline and would be possible for most people.There is a local seeking water at the peak in case you forget, but our recommendation would be to take some food with you and have breakfast with the amazing views",2019/03/21,Georgie_Fresh,"Stanstead Abbotts, United Kingdom"

Not too far away, towards Galle, is a perfect learners surf beach offering surf lessons and board hire. You can hire boards at Marissa but the waves are dumpers towards the afternoon and the water is flat earlier on. There is a spot if you are a fit, good surfer. There’s a break near the rocks (point) where you can catch some waves.",2019/03/21,Winksters,"Mullaloo, Australia"
This place is pricy and it is quite a climb but well worth it for the view. All info we found said it opens at 7am but the guy in our hotel told us 6.30. We were so pleased we took his advice as by the time we came back down 8.30(ish) the place was heaving with tourists and it was baking hot. Really would advise getting to the ticket office for opening at 6.30 am as it makes for a much more pleasant experience.,2019/03/20,ClaireB25,"Darlington, United Kingdom"
very nice but stupidly no cable car. so the claiming can be difficult for some  especially in the worm and the humidity,2019/03/20,5466,Rehovot
This is a must for all tourists and certainly worth the climb. However I would recommend getting there early! Firstly the are less people there so you can actually see the caves properly! Secondly the sun isn’t on you until you get to the top! Stunning views of the surrounding area. Well organised!,2019/03/20,Kaytie66,"Holmfirth, United Kingdom"
"We climbed this about 3-30 pm in the afternoon to avoid the morning crowds. This was a good decision taken by our driver Lasi on our Best of Sri Lanka tour.It took 2 fairly fit 62 year olds about 40 mins to get to the top , what a great all round view( quite safe as metal stairs up to the viewpoint)",2019/03/20,119claire,"Hoddesdon, United Kingdom"

"We pre-booked a jeep from the park. We were picked up early morning at our hotel by the nice driver. It had drizzled a bit in the night so most tracks were wet. Too bad we hired a jeep from the park, those Tata trucks are not as powerful. We got twice stuck and were pulled out by Toyota’s of other tour operators.The four hour drive through the park was good. We saw lots of animals. But unfortunately not the leopard. We didn’t encountered many other trucks. The park is really great and you really must visit here but take another company and not the jeeps from the park itself.",2019/03/20,Ativoo,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates"
"We were staying at the Amari Galle, which is a 10min tuk tuk ride away from the fort. It cost us 500Sr each way (£2). Our first driver offered to wait for us but there really is no need. There’s loads of tuk tuks around and it was easy getting back to our hotel. We had a leisurely walk around the walls which took about 40 mins at a slow pace. Along the way there was a very picturesque lighthouse and for cricket fans; a cracking view of the Galle Stadium. We also wandered the streets inside the walls, which had a very chilled out vibe and bags of colonial Dutch charm. Loads of restaurants around if you fancy a refreshment break. This was definitely worth seeing and would recommend. Iain, London",2019/03/20,Iain73,"London, United Kingdom"

It is enclosed in a golden casket, and this casket in another, that in another, and so on. The outermost casket is big and golden, similar in the shape of a Buddhist pagoda. The sacred tooth relic will be openly exhibited only at a special exhibition event, and that too is an irregular and rare occasion. It is said that such exhibition of the tooth relic is done at an extreme drought condition in the Island, in order to start rain.White attire is accepted at this temple; long trousers of modest colour and decent white shirt is accepted for males, and any white clothing that well covers the body is accepted for females.Don't forget to visit the very interesting museum inside the temple, and the stuffed body of the tusker 'Raja' who carried the holy casket in the annual pageant for many years.",2019/03/20,Suresh D,"Kandy, Sri Lanka"
"Our guide took us to this temple, and it was one of the most impressive of our Asian tour. You will need to take off your shoes, and for a small price they will be put in a special area, although it didn't look much more protected than the sidewalk. The main temple and the one closest to the street is gorgeous. The exterior of the building is highly decorated, and the interior is stunning. There is not a lot of room inside for all of the statues, pillars, etc. but it is definitely worth a lingering look. Once you leave this building, things get very interesting. There is a centuries old sacred tree, but the most surprising thing about this temple was all of the ""stuff,"" and I do mean stuff. The faithful leave gifts and these gifts include beautiful religious objects, but also dining room sets, money clips, even artillery shells. These objects are housed in several buildings, and if you have a very diligent guide he will want you to see everything. By the time you arrive to the building with the machine gun behind a glass case, you will be exhausted. You might discuss with your guide that you are interested in the main features of the temple complex so that you won't end up spending more time than you wish.

Although it was hot and crowded it's worth the effort if you don't mind heights. Some of the steps make you feel exposed even though it's perfectly safe. There are dogs and wild monkeys but they weren't a problem. The young Sri Lankan men who walk along side you offering to assist you every step of the way are a nuisance.

"Like most touristspots, this one is also too expensive Rs5430. We were unlucky that it was weekend. It was crowded even when we tried to be early as possible at the Lion’s Rock. It took us an hour to climb it. Because it was crowded you went little by little and you were never out of breath for the climb. Almost at the top there was some murals. Very nice paintings.Almost at the top you reached the two giant lion’s paws. From here you entered the last part of the climb. On the top are the ruins of the palace. With a little imagination you can see where and how the buildings were made. You have a great view of the surrounding area. Down goes much quicker and easier. I love the cobra hood cave. It is worth visiting but the price has to come down for tourists. Try to avoid weekends!",2019/03/17,Ativoo,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates"

This is a wonderful wildlife park. Our guide provided by Asda tours ensured we saw every kind of animal there is to see including the elusive leopard and sloth bear. He was knowledgeable and knew the right places to be at the right times. He explained habitat and feeding patterns and knew every bird along the way. Excellent guide and fantastic tour,2019/03/17,SarnieR,
"Yala National Park is the most popular park for a reason - there’s lots of wildlife! It’s brilliant. Don’t be put off by the tales of 100s of jeeps rushing to the same spots. While it’s true, it only lasts for the first hour or so, and then jeeps spread out and do their own thing. They do share sighting locations which is only fair. I recommend the full day because you can see any animal at any time e.g. we saw four leopards over the whole day. We booked through our resort The Yala Adventure they were reasonably priced and provided very knowledgable guides, a bird spotters guide and cared about the environment. I think anyone can book through them - it’s worth checking they respond to emails etc very quickly.",2019/03/17,English_Ali,"London, United Kingdom"
Our accommodation was within the fort walls so exploring the fort was a lot easier as we could pop back to our room for cold drinks etc.When walking along the wall bordering the sea you can see because of the height why the Tsunami in 2004 didn’t do much damage to the fort area. The streets are of course full of restaurants and shops for tourists but you are not put under too much pressure which is refreshing.We spent the best part of a day just wandering around and enjoying the piece of history.Well worth the visit.,2019/03/17,307cliver,"Royal Tunbridge Wells, United Kingdom"

"One objective : to make money.Here (and in many other places in Sri Lanka, unfortunately ...), they make you pay. First, you have tickets selling machines at the entrance : you put your bills (7.5€) and it spits out your entrance ticket. It gives you the mood ... Not even somebody talks to you, just people that helps you to get to the machines.Then, you can see the ""Special Guests Room"", where people who have more money than the others can enjoy soft seats and some tea while the others stand and wait, and that can go before EVERYBODY ELSE (they openly walk in front of the whole queue, doubling everybody) to go and see the Buddha Tooth through a special door. (Check my pictures, you can se that).Finally, you can see that people pray with bills in their hands, depicting the whole spirit around here : spit out your money and you will be blessed. (Here again, check my pictures)We were horrified to see this and we left, without waiting for a small sight of the Tooth.This is not Buddha's spirit.Oh, and I forgot the museum guide that followed me and asked me to check through my phone to see if I didn't take any pictures (what in Hell does that disturb anything or anyone ?!)Oh, and I forgot again the beautiful shrine ... ""Made in China"". (Pictures again)Don't go to that not-anymore-sacred place. Please, don't give your money to this Buddha Business Plan they built, and try to ask for smaller temples (and even more beautiful) in which the monks are happy to welcome you with fruits and tea (and don't ask for any money at all).",2019/03/17,Kevin R,"Herault, France"

Be warned, it is a busy tourist and religious attraction, so there are crowds during the ceremony. Instead of rushing to the line to see the tooth, we headed to the museum side of the temple and read about the history with almost no one around us. Later, we went upstairs and walked by the doorway where the tooth is housed. We lucked out with timing when they opened the door and caught a glimpse inside. Be prepared for the crowds' attempt to push up towards the doorway, and enjoy the people watching (easier if you're taller than the crowd). Remember to wear clothing to cover your shoulders and knees. You'll also need to leave your shoes at the designated booth outside the temple.",2019/03/17,ktucks23,"Guangzhou, China"
"Although very important place for the Buddhists, tourists pay big money to see a Temple! Very limited time they open the main door of the temple, but still no one can see, or go close to the real relics, unless you are a big politician! It is covered by GOLD chains, Gems studded decorations! Buddha left the rich prince hood to become a simple man, leaving all the GOLD behind the palace. And here this temple showing different kind of Buddhism, not the real teaching of Buddha. If the Lord Buddha visits this temple today he will be surprised and ashamed to see this kind of temple using his name doing big business! As a Buddhist I was not very happy to see this kind of Gold decorated Relics, and extremely unhappy about limited opening time. There are lots of beautiful temples in sri Lanka are free for tourists! Avoid this place!!!",2019/03/17,jaywithanage,"new west, bc"
The temple housed the sacred relic of Buddha ie his tooth. Dress modestly for your visit. It’s free to enter the grounds but you must pay and remove your shoes if you’re going into the main temple.

"If you have any sentimental or cultural ties then you might like it but it was certainly not for me. We were a family of 5 and hired a private tour company in Sri Lanka. They made sure that we reach there in the evening when the tooth relic was displayed for a short period of time. First of all, it's not actually the original tooth relic but a replica which is shown. Second, it gets crazy crowded at that time. The number one reason I wanted to visit Sri Lanka (or any other country in the world) is to beat the crowd. There was absolutely no order in the temple and people were pushing each other like mad. Our tour guide started pushing us in the front so that we can get a better glimpse of the basket carrying the replica. After a couple of minutes I gave up and came out of the crowd. I could not understand the point of all this. It could have been great if they made a seating arrangement and allow people in batches of 50-100 at a time and explain them the history of the temple.It was an expensive tour. I guess 1000 Sri Lankan Rupees per person. We also hired a guide. Since I am very much interested in history, I thought the guide would give us a lot of insight about the temple and the history of this place associated with Buddha. To be frank, I had more knowledge of the history by reading through web articles than the guide. They have an official counter there for hiring a guide (your tour guides are not allowed entry inside and if you want to hire a guide you will have to hire an official one). The guide was a complete disaster.To each his own. It you are not looking for a spiritual experience, you can simply drop this place. I have had my fair share of temples and shrines in India. I wish I knew all these things in advance.",2019/03/16,spockmohit,"Noida, India"

We visited the Temple of the Tooth as part of a large group one evening and were inside the temple during the seven minute window that the tooth was accessible. This was a very overcrowded time which made our experience very stressful. As a group we did not have time to see the Tooth Relic. The Temple itself is very nice and worth visiting as there are other relics and artefacts to view as well as watching people pray and offer gifts. We were left a little disappointed that we didn’t see the Tooth Relic but nice to say we’ve done it.*Note: both men and women must have their shoulders and legs covered and you must walk around the Temple bare-footed.,2019/03/16,CroxleyJD,"Croxley Green, United Kingdom"
"The entrance fee for foreigners is 30 usd... I thought this was excessive given locals only pay 50 rupees, however it does include the museum. It is the same fee to just do the museum, whether you climb the rock or not. It is by far the most expensive attraction in Sri Lanka. The climb will challenge many, as it is 100m up to the frescoes, of which only 19 remain in various states of repair, higher still to the summit. You cannot photograph the frescoes, this was banned in 2015. You risk having your camera confiscated and possible fines if you try it. It is very crowded. Yes, there are some good views from the top, if there is no mist, but you will have many more photo opportunities as you travel around this beautiful country.

After a comfortable walk through gardens and stone walkways at the base of the rocky mountain, there is a serious climb to the top with at least one detour along the way with Buddhist wall paintings. The final part of the climb after the lion's foot is on steep metal stairways. This is steep although with hand guards and a fence to prevent falls. The whole climb is a good workout so this is not recommended for those who are in poor physical condition.

"Staying in Nuwara Eliya I hired a tuk tuk for a return trip for 3000R. Leaving at 5 a.m. we got there just after 6 a.m. and there were already lots of people queuing for tickets. It was 4777R for one person plus driver which I thought was very expensive. The general advise is to get there early morning as the views at worlds end clouds over after 10 a.m. It’s a 9 km walk in a circular route, where you have the choice to go left or right at the first junction. Going left you reach worlds end first, as opposed Bakers fall by going right. I took the left to get to worlds end early and was rewarded by only having a few people there. The views are good with a vertical drop of over 800 metres. After 20 mins lots more tourists arrived so I moved on. Luckily when reaching Bakers falls later again there were very few people. The rest of the walk is nice but nothing spectacular and took around 2 hours in total. I didn’t see much in terms of wildlife but there are deer and even Leopards supposedly. In summary, this is a nice walk, but rather expensive if you compare it to walking in other national parks.",2019/03/14,JohnP72,"London, United Kingdom"

Also, you visit the temple barefoot Now, we wanted o visit the temple during the puja (prayer) but unfortunately we couldn't so we went .there an hour before and still we were not disappointed! It is a must do in Kandy. You get to watch people pray and walk in the place with offerings which I thought was very beautiful. There are several rooms so there is quite a lot to see : paintings, sculptures...It can get extremely crowded especially when the prayer time comes.

But along with that is that it’s a town big enough to feel like you are really living among the people and can break out of the tourist scene.Not so much a place to come for nightlife, or at least not that we’ve yet found now on day five, not really looking that hard, but definitely a very nice place to chill lax and observe some Sri Lankan culture.The train ride to get here from Colombo is exceedingly affordable and breathtaking as it runs right along the coast almost the entire way.Once here, it’s very easy to just jump on a passing bus to explore further down the coast line to places like Galle which offers more high-end shopping gorgeous views and lots of interesting history. In addition to tourism, fishing is a primary industry here and another fun thing to do is to go check out where the fishing boats bring their early morning catch and watch all of the locals making their choices.Don’t miss the surrounding neighborhoods and some of the treasures that they hold, small mom-and-pop businesses that offer great value and wonderful experiences. Also don’t miss a place sectioned off on the beach where baby turtles are kept safe beneath the sand until the eggs hatch and they are kept safe from predators until they are able to make their way down to the water.You can swim right up to the sea turtles but please please don’t touch. Touching may seem harmless but chemicals that we carry on our hands, like sunscreen, is very damaging to them. Locals are OK though with you feeding the turtles bits of seaweed which is a thrill to experience even vicariously.I have yet to do it but there is a living coral reef right up near the shore where you can snorkel.",2019/03/13,rhondarecreates,"Hikkaduwa, Sri Lanka"

There is so much wildlife while travelling round the park - we found it absolutely fascinating. The were many different types of birds - my particular interest.As others have said there are many jeeps on the limited roads - this has positive and negative features. It means there are so many eyes looking for the rarities and the jeeps communicate such that you can be called to see that rarity. Conversely some of the dusty rough roads are busy with traffic.Must say that the drivers are skilled at spotting hidden animals/birds and driving through deep mud or deep hollowsWould definitely visit again,2019/03/13,fpg,"Mansfield, United Kingdom"

"From our hotel we'd watched people climbing up here in the dark by torchlight to witness the sunrise, but certainly on a couple of mornings prior to our climb the mist or cloud rolled in and I don't think the hikers saw anything. We chose to start our hike at 8am so we could see where we were going and enjoy the route and could tell what the weather would be like. Perfect!The climb is almost all stepped so is easy if you take your time. the views are good, and after taking photos and enjoying the panorama, you can be back in 98 Acres in just under an hour.Worth the hike in our opinion.",2019/03/13,Jeff W,

"My wife and I spent a thoroughly enjoyable couple of hours visiting this World famous temple during our recent birdwatching tour of Sri Lanka. We had previously engaged a Guide to show us around the temple. To get the best out of a visit this is a must. Our guide was very knowledgeable and fully explained the history of the Temple and the Tooth Relic. Our visit coincided with the revealing of the Gold Caskets. The tooth relic is encased in seven golden caskets which are engraved with precious gemstones. This only happens every few years. The temple covers a large area and as ever with these historical sites isn’t particularly disabled friendly, several steps and flights of stairs. Having said that we thoroughly enjoyed our visit and with the assistance of out guide we now have a greater insight into the life and teaching of Bubbha. A thoroughly enjoyable visit.

This temple really show everything. Very beautiful statues of Buddha and also a lot of handicrafts like hand carved wood with ebony. Copper pictures are amazing. It’s like a mix of a temple and a museum.As a tourist you pay around 400 rupees and then get cover for knees and shoulders (if your not prepared by yourself).Worth a visit!,2019/03/13,ViolaG6,"Colombo, Sri Lanka"

"Galle is held up as one of the best ‘must see’ places in Sri Lanka, mostly due to the UNESCO status of its Fort. I’m sorry to say this, I was there yesterday, but I wouldn’t recommend a visit for those wanting to see the best of Sri Lanka. The Fort has piles of rubbish lining its beaches and down small side alleys, not just the odd plastic bottle. No one seemed to care. It is expensive to stay and eat. While shop owners and restauranteurs where accommodating and welcoming, the overall atmosphere was one of complacency. I think we may have been scammed into donating to a children’s nursery too - it’s seemed genuine but it was hard to tell because of the way it was done. I left Galle rather depressed and hoping the rest of my time in Sri Lanka would be much better. I’ve only ever heard good things about the country.",2019/03/12,English_Ali,"London, United Kingdom"

Left the Temple towards the end of our stay and visited early in the morning to avoid the crowds. A beautiful temple but you only get a quick viewing of where the Sacred Tooth is located as the guides very quickly urge you on past it. The rest of the site has some very good museums which are well worth spending some time in,2019/03/12,CanaryBoy007,
"The Temple of the Tooth is Sri Lanka's most important Buddist shrine & is of course a must visit attraction.Do try to be there for one of the daily Pujas. 5.30am,9.30am & 6.30pm. Expect crowds & a lot of pushing as you file past the casket housing the tooth relic.The drummers at the entrance to the relic chamber will entertain you as you queue to look at the casket.",2019/03/12,Mary F,"Dublin, Ireland"
"I appreciate the history and the cultural importance that the temple of the tooth relic represents for Sri Lankan’s and Buddhists, but for a tourist it doesn’t really have much to see unlike other Buddhist temples / sites as the temple buildings themselves are not visually spectacular. Pooja takes place 3 times a day, I went at 18.30 and it seemed too busy with tourists as opposed to locals praying, so for me it also lacked genuine atmosphere. In case you wondered, the tooth is not on display to the public, and at 1500R entrance fee I thought it was quite expensive, but it is one of Sri Lanka’s UNESCO world heritage sites. Alternatively whilst in Kandy you could take a nice stroll around the lake followed by Udawatakelle sanctuary which I enjoyed more.",2019/03/12,JohnP72,"London, United Kingdom"
We were so impressed by the sheer number of people visiting and their attitude and respect for the surroundings. Our visit was quite extraordinary and we were both moved by the occasion.

Visited the temple in the evening which is a crowded time. Even though we couldn't see the place in to our satisfaction our guide gave a us really good explanation about the history of this temple.

But beware of you dress as they wont allow anything above the knee and sleeveles tops as this is the most sacred place of the buddhists.,2019/03/12,masonclark54,"Melbourne, Australia"
This is a most religious site for Bhuddist and consequently it gets very crowded with devotees.

"Highly recommended to do, but preferably with a guide who can provide the historical facts about the place.

Also recommended is Pidurangala Rock so you can see back to Lion's Rock.",2019/03/11,R H,"York, United Kingdom"
Early morning climb. Worth it when you get the views. Go as early as possible.  It gets very busy & can be a little clostrophobic on stairways,2019/03/11,Alison H,"Wilmslow, United Kingdom"
"Like a lot of key historical sites in Sri Lanka, Lions Rock is crazily priced for foreigners at $30 when put in context to the cost of other things. It also might be better trying the climb at sunset as when I went at 07.30 a.m. it was very misty which obscured the views, and there were already a couple of hundred people as it seems the general advise is to go early morning. To get to the top it’s apparently 1200 steps, but it wasn’t that hard if you are reasonably fit as there are plenty of places to stop and it takes less than 30 minutes. However even at this time it was hot and unfortunately there was no breeze either, and with high humidity it was not a particularly fun climb! By the time I left at 09.00 a.m. the mist had been burned off so I took photos from the nice gardens surrounding the rock where it’s shaded and cooler. This is one of Sri Lanka’s 9 UNESCO world heritage sites so it is a must visit. But timing is key, so possibly try for sunset, but definitely not late morning or early afternoon with the heat and crowds. An alternative for views is Pidurangala Rock which is opposite and has better views, less people and is cheaper at 500R, but harder to climb especially the last part (only for the fit) and not much history. If time allows do both!",2019/03/11,JohnP72,"London, United Kingdom"
This stunning place simply is amazing and is a must on any tour.Bit of a climb up and some vertigo moments but really worth it.

A great story and a piece of real ancient history. Fascinating.Truly spectacular views from the top.Nice garden walks at the bottom and you may see a croc in the moat.Go early in the day!

As we walked to the exit I gave our guide what we felt was a good ‘tip’ he said this simply isn’t enough and demanded more money. This really has left a sour taste in my mouth.

Do the small diversion on the way up & climb the spiral staircase to see the frescos of the Sigiriya damsels.The final ascent is by way of a steel staircase but it is safe & has a good handrail. We went early morning & had no trouble with crowds.

The murals, half way up and a steep spiral staircase to reach them are good but not fantastic so you could miss this bit out if the climb is already taxing. Take a rest at the lion's feet before the final metal staricase to the top. The ruins of the palace are stunning and incredible to think how they built this in the first place so many years ago.

"We went on two game drives in Yala, both in the morning. The first thing you notice is how busy it is. Even starting very early in the morning you join a queue of thirty or forty jeeps. Once you enter the park you are almost always in the company of three or four other vehicles. Most of the vehicles are linked by radio so as soon as either a bear or leopard is seen it becomes a rush to get to the sighting. Unless you are lucky you will probably only get a long distance look in the traffic queue. That said if you go a couple of times you will probably will see more than one of the iconic large mammals.Because of the number of roads you see a lot of general wild life including birds.If you get into the park as it opens you maybe able to get back to your hotel for breakfast which is vastly superior to the packed one.There is a toilet stop however it is a traditional hole in the ground.",2019/03/10,Christine S,"Harrogate, United Kingdom"

Our safari had been organized ahead of time through a tour company, but on retrospect I would recommend making sure your safari includes a guide, The fellow driving our jeep had very little English and wasn't able provide us with any commentary as to the birds or animals that we did see. We saw plenty of water buffalo, several alligators, deer and many different birds. We saw two elephants a leopard but they were all behind the brush and we couldn't really get a good sighting. I will say some of the roads were in very poor condition, lots of ruts and bumps, so a jeep with cushioned seats is a good idea.

"While staying in Kandy we decided to go to Sigiriya, and we are glad we did! The tuk tuk ride there was almost 3 hours, but with some stops underway (we would recommend to take the stops on the way back though, as to get there as early as possible), it was okay.The Ancient City of Sigiriya is a fascinating complex, and other than providing an insight into how the ancient people of Sri Lanka might have lived, it is also a lovely feeling to get to the top and see kilometer after kilometer in every direction. The park at the foot of the rock is pretty nice as well, and you'll see monkeys and a bunch of birds.The walk up is a lot of stairs, but not undoable if you bring a lot of water and maybe some Mentos to snack on. Make sure to take breaks if you feel exhausted. A long the way you'll have the possibility of going into a cave on the side of the rock with a bunch of old paintings. The entrance price is fairly expensive, like many other places in Sri Lanka (compared to the rest of the southern part of Asia), and you'll pay around 30 dollars for entrance per person (10.700 LKR for 2 persons). Be aware that you only need to pay if you plan to enter the museum and/or climb the rock. Just visiting the park, does not require tickets.",2019/03/09,joachims268,"Odense, Denmark"
"This is the place to visit when visiting Sri Lanka. The name refers to a site of historical and archaeological significance. It is 200 metres (600 feet) high.The climb is not for faint hearted and people with dodgy knees and hips.The steps are narrow and a traveller must ensure they are wearing flat shoes rather than high heels!Visit in the morning as the afternoons can be hot.It has historical significance as Buddhist monks inhabited this place as early as 3rd venture BC. Once you climb the top and see the paintings, you will see picture gallery of at least 500 women. These paintings are similar to the ones in Ajanta caves in India.",2019/03/09,bkumar841,"Birmingham, United Kingdom"
"Ancient civilization , it is amazing to see what people can do from thousands years ago. The ticket office is not easy to find, it is in the same building as the museum, 30 USD for foreigners, combined with tickets to the museum and the mirror wall( never found it though). Best part is at the top of the rock, where gives you the view of the whole area covered by forest, it is breathtaking. Be prepared for the stairs up though, a little scary.",2019/03/09,Dealand,"Guangzhou, China"

Mirissa is so central to every surf spot its litterwlly right in the midsle ao you can head north or south. The night life has a crazy beach party every single night of the week and its really cheap. Happy hour is 4pm - 10pm . We stayed at Green Hill mirissa and man those guys Aus NZ and SA managers are legends showed us all the surf spots did surf lessons with video package and they even took us out partying when we wanted we saw the whole of mirissa because of them i cant wait to get back go this place i could stay a year here,2019/03/09,joordyshoree,"Mirissa, Sri Lanka"

"At the time of writing this there are close on 11,000 Reviews so I don't intend to write anything new about the building, the 'Tooth relic' or the worshippers. We were brought here by our guide quite late in the afternoon, around 4pm. It was essential to have a Guide (in our opinion) as there was a lot to see and take in. We only stayed an hour but could have been here longer, and really it was a great time to visit as it wasn't too busy, apart from the hall at the exit. We had a booking at 5pm at the nearby Culture dance show, so had to rush. But we learnt from others who went after the Culture dance at 6:30pm that the Temple was crammed. So ensure you time your visit to enjoy the experience, which should be relaxing and peaceful.",2019/03/09,Jeff W,
"Loved our visit and the experience of the ceremony inside the temple, with drums and pipes in the dowstairs rooms.

"If you are in Kandy you should stop by. The temple is a beautiful building, and if you visit at the right time of the year (at the Esala Perahera celebration), you'll see the tooth brought out.For the rest of the year, you'll have to make do with just seeing the gold ornated door to the place where the tooth is kept. It's a busy place, and many buddhists will come to pray, so be respectful, and keep your photographing to a minimum inside the temple. Remember to wear decent clothes, that covers knees and shoulders. Also, be aware that shoes are not allowed inside the temple complex, and you'll be asked to take them off before entering.Entrance prices will run tourists around 1.500 LKR per person.",2019/03/09,joachims268,"Odense, Denmark"
A must place to visit. Long organised queues and be patient. Wear appropriate clothes covering your shoulders. Here the corporeal remains of Buddha in the form of canine tooth is enshrined. The temple buildings have red roofs with white stone walls. The interior of the temple is carved and decorated.It feels odd when visitors are clicking away whilst devotees stand with folded hands praying.,2019/03/09,bkumar841,"Birmingham, United Kingdom"
"remember to check the dress code for this place.Leggings are no good, too needs to have sleeves long or short, pants or skirts need to be cover your knee, you need to take your shoes off after entering the gate, there is a shoe keeping place but we decided to take them with us in a bag to avoid the get them back hassle. In our culture we should not take photos of any buddha, so just took few pics, the performance in front of the tooth relic door was impressive, feels like the music can get right into your soul, if it is not so super crowded inside, you will feel like it is another world. It is definitely a must go.",2019/03/09,Dealand,"Guangzhou, China"

"We visited and paid the very hefty 30 $ each - however we didn’t want to climb as we had heard it is very busy and can be dangerous of overcrowding at points, plus I don’t like heights too much. We walked up and around the rock which is nice, but even arriving at 8.45am it was so incredibly hot, almost unbearable. After a walk around we went out the gate, and there are tuk tuk drivers that will drive you around the outside of the area for 2k rupee and you get to see incredible views of both rocks from the lake and see some local villages etc too. So if you are wanting to visit but don’t want to climb I would recommend don’t pay the ticket fee, just walk to the entry gate or restaurant and grab a tuk tuk for a fraction of the price.",2019/03/08,HJ2007,"Aylesbury, United Kingdom"
"The day I went up was a Sunday and there were extremely long queues on the approach, but these did seem to be confined to the lower parts of the climb before the spiral staircase. At that point I was minded to quit, but beyond that point everything seemed to move much more quickly.There was absolutely no “exposure” throughout the climb although it looks as though there may be as you queue on the staircases - the Sri Lankans have done a wonderful job of making it completely safe. My guide suggested we turn back after reaching the lion gate (it is a steep but short climb up the steps to the top), but having heard about the ruins on top I thought the extra effort would be well worthwhile, and I am so glad I insisted because it is a relatively small effort to see such a wonderful summit - I would never have forgiven myself if I had not done it and later seen pictures of what it is like on top.",2019/03/08,964DavidE,"Leicester, United Kingdom"
"We are both in our mid 50s unfit and a little over weight, but we did it, it’s hard going and it took us at a steady pace just over an hour to get to the top including a 10 min break 3 quarters of the way up.Coming down is a different route and took us about 30 mins.It opens at 06:30, and between 06:30 and 07:00 is the best time to go, the organise coach tours tours start arriving at 8am and and it starts to get packed, and will take you twice as long to climb up. Take plenty of water, and least a couple of small bottles each. But at the top what amazing views",2019/03/08,st1ven33,"Southampton, United Kingdom"
"We visited ancient city of Sigiriya and climb on Lion’s rock, to get the wonderful view over the ruins of ancient city of Sigiriya. Absolutely worth visiting.

The entrance fee for adult is 30 $ and for kid (from 6 - 12) 15$.",2019/03/08,KlemenKras,"Sigiriya, Sri Lanka"

Well worth the sweat and upteen bottles of water.Summary - if you’re wanting an elavator to the top, there isn’t one.

Although the highlights are supposed to be Baker’s Falls, World’s End, and Little World’s End, the walk through the park is spectacular with the most wonderful blue skies when I was there. As others mention there is a ridiculous queue to get into the park, not because there are too many people trying to get in, but because of the long time it seems to take to process the paperwork- there was only one person dealing with it when I was there although there seemed to be plenty of staff around.",2019/03/08,964DavidE,"Leicester, United Kingdom"

"7 of us visited Yala N P through Holaday Tours (Marino D'Sa and Ashley Remedios of Mumbai India) in February 2019. We had a smooth flight to Colombo - though it was late by the time we exited the airport, we had a happy Gayaan welcoming us with garlands of pink 'chaafa' flowers. Global Towers at Colombo served a hearty breakfast and we started our drive to Yala. On the way we stopped for a lovely buffet lunch at Emmalaya on Tangalle road where we tasted lovely Sri Lankan cuisine. By evening we checked in at Hotel Elephant Eye - a lovely new place with large well appointed rooms. Next day early morning at 0500 we drove to Yala. That was a real wonderful experience. Saw elephants monitor lizards, mongooses,crocodiles and the apex predator of Yala - the Sri Lankan leopard Panthera pardus kotiya. On the afternoon safari we got a lovely sighting of another leopard and we were lucky to be chased by a lovely tusker bull elephant. Next day we went to Galle , went scuba diving at Unawatuna and were put up at Fairway Sunset - another new hotel with good facilities. The following day we went whale watching at Mirissa and then went to Bentota where we visited a sea turtle hatchery. That evening we checked back into Global Towers at Colombo and had good luck at the casino! After that it was back to Mumbai. We got money's worth, places we wanted to see at our pace and had a great guide in Gayaan. Would recommend anytime. Especially with Marino and Ashley and Holaday.

"Are you on a pilgrimage? Do you want to pray to an actual body part of Buddha (that you can’t see)? Then you’re in luck! This place is for you.For us (Brits on holiday) it was an interesting walk around the well-kept grounds which contained Buddhist buildings, and then the walk through the main event. If you’re here for photographs and people-watching this place is great. There’s insence huts, paraffin candle lighting in families, a history of the ‘tooth’, and 000s/0000s or locals doing their religious thing.Can you see the tooth? Nope, it’s all in a secured room. Is it strict to get in? Yes, very. You need shoulders and legs covered and they mean ‘properly covered’. No tights for example (even if they’re down to the shoe)Summary - it’s cheap and it’s worth a visit to observe the local traditions. Do it, but don’t expect the tooth fairy.",2019/03/08,stumac14,"Nha Trang, Vietnam"

"We had a guide so visiting was made more enjoyable. It is a temple and yes locals get in for free. But I have no issue with tourists like myself paying. As tourists we just want to be most and have a look and take photos, and not really meditate or pay respects with offerings etc as the locals do.So if you go on your own you may not understand some of the background to this temple or the various sections of the temple grounds that you can enter. I don't think I would have enjoyed it without a guide. It's crowded, it was interesting to see why the Buddhists venerate this relic and the history behind it.",2019/03/08,GlobeTrotters4001,"Brisbane, Australia"

It is also regarded as one of the most holy, and they have a stricter dress code than many others so that for men long trousers rather than over-the-knee shorts seem to be required.

There is a lot to see and understand so this is worth doing.The climb to the top is 100% worth it.

Unusually it was very misty, approaching the rock from the entrance with the sun behind it made for a great photo opportunity.Once on top I spent 30 minutes ambling around admiring what is left of the palace. Amazed by the ingenuity of how they got water up to the top and into the water storage areas carved by hand.For the next hour I sat on the east side of the rock watching the mist clear and the sun rise.

"It's not the greatest walk I've been on, but it was different and enjoyable. I wouldn't want to do it in the middle of the day as I thought it was quite hot when we walked - from about 7.20 to 10.30.There is a cloud forest in this area so you'd have to get there very early or be very lucky to strike the World's End without a lot of cloud. But they said, I didn't mind standing near the edge and watching the cloud roll in and up and over the cliff face. Sit long enough and the cloud lightens enough for you to see the valley below and some of the tea fields. If you follow the track on the left it is the shortest to the viewing platforms but it makes the walk back via the falls a steeper climb, so I personally preferred walking anti-clockwise and getting to the platform after the crowds and then having an easier walk back along the less steep ridge.Frogs, forest pigeon and a Sri Lankan giant squirrel were our rewards for walking this trail. The squirrel looked like an Australian tree kangaroo in the face but had a large bushy tail. You can hear the bear monkeys in the jungle here as well and we're so lucky in that on the very bumpy drive back down the plateau a bear monkey was posing for us on a tree Top. So keep a look out.As walks go it was moderate - some steep slippery sections, and the landscape it crosses was quite interesting - undulating hills, interspersed with grasslands and forests.I don't know what the park fees were as we did it as part of a package so in some respects it's better not to know and as I think the most expensive fees, it was nice to see the Rangers being very vigilant with hikers as far as long plastics go and to search each bag and advise to bring everything back out. So surprisingly I saw very little plastic litter - the off pieces carelessly dropped but good to see they are trying to keep the area litter free - except the toilet area - unfortunately full of rubbish.",2019/03/07,GlobeTrotters4001,"Brisbane, Australia"
"Stayed here for the last night of a Mercury Tour of Sri Lanka.The hotel is in a stunning location with amazing views over the beach.The hotel is obviously very old but has been modernised to a decent standard.The food was absolutely stunning with an amazing choice, spread over two rooms, best we encountered on our stay in the country.However the service in the restaurant was really poor. It was difficult to order a drink at the table and very slow to arrive once ordered. Used plates were not cleared and were allowed to pile up on the table. Such a shame as the food was so good.Finally as it was the last night of our tour and we were all going our seperate ways the following day we decided to go for a few drinks outside around the pool. Could not get anyone to take the drinks order until we went and found a reluctant waiter who took one look at the size of the goup, took the the first couple of orders and just left us sitting there whilst he went and started clearing plates from other tables which was quite ironic following our experiences in the restaurant.Eventually someone went and got a manager who did take the order but the drinks were very slow to arrive. In some cases well over 30 minutes. Such a shame that this level of service lets down the hotel, and spoilt what should have been a pleasant evening at the end of our tour.",2019/03/07,BrundallbazNorwich,"Norwich, United Kingdom"

It definitely made the tour more entertaining. We did the climb in February. The weather was very hot and humid, so climbing can get really difficult in the afternoon (we learned our lessons when we climbed to the cave temple at Dambulla the day before). We started around 8.30 AM, and everyone was still pretty tired. It took us around 2 hours 30 mins to complete the tour. There is an entrance fee of 30 USD if you are from a Non SAARC country and $15 USD if you are from a SAARC country. You need to show your passport at the ticket counter if you want to buy at the discounted price.",2019/03/06,ShamaFarabi,"Hillsboro, Oregon"
"I'm sure with nearly 10,500 reviews of this site it's all been said before, however, I would say that my wife was quite daunted by the climb but found it most worthwhile and would do it again. The steps are safe with handrails and the final part of the climb is via a well constructed walkway with separate steps for those travelling either up or down. A no point are you traversing rocks or open spaces with a danger of falling. Just take your time.Point 2. Be very aware of the monkeys especially around the Lion Claws and on the summit, they will steal anything they can and very quickly!Point 3. You CANNOT PHOTOGRAPH THE FRESCOS, (even without flash) - it is just not allowed and is firmly policed and enforced. If you want a record of the lovely ladies ensure you photograph the replicas in the museum before you go on the climb.Point 4. Enjoy! - it's a remarkable place with an amazing history and you won't regret your visit.",2019/03/06,Jeff W,
Fantastic World Heritage site. An early start at 07:00 is recommended to avoid the heat and crowds. The climb is worth as the view from the Rock is spectacular. The entrance fee for foreigners is ridiculous as it does not include anything for this cost. A brochure/leaflet summarising the history of the place should at least be included with the ticket so no additional fee is required for a guide. It is extremely crowded between 7:30 and 09:00 and there should be a system to control the numbers going up at a time as the stairs are very narrow and steep at the top.,2019/03/06,Holidays_KD,"Mississauga, Canada"
"It is worth getting the history about the rock from a guide and then go up, it makes it much more interesting than just a view.The climb up is not as difficult as it seems. Before I visited I was not going to go up but when I got there decided to do it, and, not only did I do it, but in pouring rain.Try to go early and avoid the crowds as the steps are not that wide and people go up and come down the same steps.",2019/03/06,Taki P,"London, United Kingdom"
"While based in the Nuwara Eliya area our birding group spent one half a day in the Horton Plains National Park. We arrived very early (as did everyone else), this is a popular place to watch the sun rise, but soon we left the crowds behind as our mission was to find some of the endemic birds of the region. Even with all the people there is plenty of room to avoid the crowds as this park is huge. This turned out to be a very pleasant mornings experience, even though it is a long drive to get to the park entrance.",2019/03/06,MichaelFleming01,"Seattle, Washington"
"Mount Lavania, is a wonderful beach right next to the city. It is not a scenic beach like other Sri Lankan beaches, but it is still very beautiful.

If you don't have the time to go out of Colombo, this is the best beach to visit.",2019/03/06,SriyaniT,Lincoln

"We were her 2 years ago, and returned because it is still a magical and spectacular experience, despite so many other like us trying to have the same!The good - great variety of birds, crocodiles, deer, mongeese, warthogs, jackals, elephants, and a leopard! Spectacular scenery.Not so good - too many of us, too many jeeps.We did an afternoon safari and an early morning one, both were very good, we were pleased to avoid the leopard hunt queues as the other wildlife in quieter settings was worth the visit. We saw more activity parked for 10 minutes by a lakeside than travelling in convoys, the reserve is still a great place to go.",2019/03/06,Coombers,"Gloucestershire, United Kingdom"
"We had both an afternoon and an early morning safari booked here.The afternoon driver took us for a leisurely drive through the park hoping to find the two main animals for us to see - leopard and sloth bear. The morning safari became a bit more of a bone jarrer as we ran overtime and had to get back quickly.However, we were rewarded with a mother leopard and one cub casually wandering through the undergrowth the first afternoon and a young leopard lounging on a rock on the morning safari. But no sloth bears, but lots of elephants , monkeys, buffalo, wild pigs, kites, mongooses, jungle fowls, green and chestnut bee eaters, water birds, blue kingfishers, spotted deer, samba deer, crocodiles large and small - so lots of wildlife even if we didn't see the sloth bear.Unfortunately every guide/driver is trying to get the sightings for their clients so they'll be happy, so the end result is a traffic jam of safari jeeps converging on the spot where the animal had been seen. So I can understand some people's frustration if they don't see the leopard or the sloth bear causing the traffic jam.On our second safari we had gone mainly to see if we could sight the sloth bear so it was a slow drive to the known spots for sloth bears, but even sitting and waiting at the place it had been seen, we were not rewarded, but for me c'est la vie, he tried.I can understand some comments about the park and the number of vehicles that seem to converge. But my purpose was to see the very rare Sri Lankan leopard, and the fact I was able to see three with this safari company in this park, I am very happy.My biggest complaint was more to do with the way drivers of vehicles won't move on even when they've given their clients ample time to take photos, they will not move on to allow others to see the animal. But I can understand they are all wanting to earn a living and all wanting to please their customers, but just some courtesy between drivers would be nice - as our driver called out to another fellow driver, to let others through to see the animal. Three vehicles coming from the opposite direction had not moved by the time we had worked on our down to the leopard's location - some 8 or more cars passed those selfish three. Perhaps have it as part of their access to the park, that once they've had enough time for their clients to take a couple of pictures, that they move on to allow others through and not bank all the vehicles up and ""hog"" the sighting. As far as the sheer number of vehicles hassling the wildlife, I didn't find this to be the case.The mother and her cub we saw with quite a few others, was just casually walking through the undergrowth with no urgency. The elephant in the scrub just kept eating and wandering slowly about. The elephant in the water with three birds on his head, just kept twirling water grass in his trunk and eating. Amazingly the leopard on the rock, lounged for such a long time in the shade, we were able to see it by the time our vehicle managed to get through on a very rough track and then it walked off the rock and walked along up closer to other vehicles behind us, and sat down on another rock for those people to see. So I didn't feel the jeeps hassled them at all. The drivers just need to be a bit more mindful that there are other people who'd also like the opportunity if possible to see a rare sighting.",2019/03/06,GlobeTrotters4001,"Brisbane, Australia"

From the entrance it is a simple walk till the base. There is another option of taking tuk tuk till there. The walk isnt difficult anyways. You will also get to click pictures in tea plantation along the way. There are two ways to reach the base of the Little Adam's peak. Take the one from the left side (which shows direction towards the villas). And after a while take the right. This will help avoid climbing around 50 steps in the end. Its not a very tough climb after that. The views are excellent. Just too good. This one cannot be missed!! At sunset the views keep getting better. You can spend roughly 2-3 hrs here.

"Sri Lanka is a island country in Indian ocean. In Sri lanka trip you can get hill station, national park and sea beach, Metro life at a time.Season for travel.From mid September you can visit Sri lanka. November December and January are peak season in Sri lanka.In the sri lanka vacation on 3rd day we went to bentota from Kandy. It is a beach destination in West coast of Sri Lanka. There we took bentota river boat ride. The boat has gone through mangrove forest. There are lot of water sports agent. You can easily book it. The cost of boat ride 10 USD per person. It was 40 minutes boat journey. There are lot of sports activity like speed boat riding, jet ski etc. We spent that night in bentota hotel. Bentota beach is very silent and clear and beautiful, but for taking sea bath it is quite risky. If tourist want beautiful but silence beach destination, then Bentota is the best option. Next day I took another boat ride. That is Madhu Ganga boat ride. The cost was 10 USD per person. This is 2 hr boat journey. After boat ride we moved to Galle. There we have seen light house, some old architecture. We came back in bentota hotel. Bentota to Galle distance is 75km. It will takes 2 hr.

"Our guide suggested we visit later in the day ....we followed the travellers advice and not our tour guide and got up early and arrived at 7.15am It only took 30 mins of leisurely climbing To get to the topOur tour guide said 3-4pm would be fine but we’re pleased we researched this and stuck to our guns . We had a leisurely 30 min crowd free and queue free walk to the top and as we departed there was literally hundreds and hundreds arriving by coach load - it would have taken hours and been unbearably hot in 32* Also ignore your guide and don’t take the spiral staircase half way up - waste of energy as it doesn’t go anywhere except up then back down - totally pointless!Walk ahead just a little further and you reach a large plateau of ruins at the foot of the Lions Staircase where you can rest and take photos of the same view with plenty of space around you Carry on a few flights more to reach the top to witness the fantastic views - all stress free and in cool morning air the steps to reach the very top Bypass the spiral staircase half way up - total waste of energy! It goes nowhere and a little further on is a nice plateau of ruins at the foot of the lion staircase to rest and take in the views , take photos without feeling hurried",2019/03/02,Y437,"Nottingham, United Kingdom"
"The climb was easy for us since we were in a queue the whole way up and it took about 80 minutes. The slow speed suited us since it was a cloudy, windy day and standing around in the sun was not an issue. Interesting paintings on the way up and the city remains on the summit are amazing, as is the view. Take your time, rather than too many photos, and absorb the atmosphere.

Would not advise visiting after 9am as crowds got really crazy and by the time 11 o'clock came, the queue was all the way down and at a stand still (no thanks in that heat!). For those worried about the physical side of things - there are plenty of areas to stop and rest on the way up. Also it is well maintained small steps all the way to the top. Just a personal opinion but we did Pidurangala Rock straight after -queues are tiny in comparison and an even better view looking on to Sirigiya and for 500 rupees, your going to save yourself a fortune.",2019/03/02,Lucyandjackstravels,

"Incredible wildlife! We saw elephants, leopard, buffalo, boar, spotted deer, sambur deer, crocs, monitor lizards, iguana and too many bird and insect species to list. Truly incredible!!!We chose to stay in the park all day rather than do the more common double visit of a morning and evening trip and we feel that what we did worked better. It's important to know that what you get to see depends SO much on your guide so be careful to choose a reliable company and my advice is ask for an ""old hand"", like So'me (so-mee) our guide who drove slowly and considerately at all times, constantly looking for and pointing out things of interest. Conversely some of the ""young buck"" guides spent their time on their mobiles waiting for news of sightings and then drove dangerously at high speed across kilometers to see an elephant or a leopard that was long gone by the time they arrived.Most of the trucks are 6 seaters and if your vehicle is full you can't change seat and may find yourself missing something interesting on the wrong side of the vehicle and/or in a very hot spot in full sun, so have sun-screen, long sleeves to cover up, and a hat - or book a vehicle with just two to four of you so you have room to move around. And take lots and lots of water because there is none available once you are in the park - we were 12 hours on or trip and we were parched by the end of it.Don't miss it.

"The beach is very nice and clean, the water was very warm (around 28 degrees) and also clean and there were some nice big waves sometimes (that's if you are into big waves). But be aware that it can get very crowded sometimes. We were in February 2019 and until 10 am you had to occupy a sun bed, otherwise they was nothing free anymore until around 4 pm (or you had to be lucky). One thing which i didn't like: all the restaurants (to whom the sunbeds belonged) were telling you at around 4:30 pm-5 pm to get off the sunbeds, because they were replacing them with tables for dinners. I found that they did this much too early ! It was exactly the time when the sun wasn't that strong anymore and it was really nice to lie in the sun and you had to go. I know that it gets dark really fast there, but still , I wish they had begun with this at 6 pm or later. The area around the beach is not nice though. There is a LOT of garbage lying around everywhere and stinking (especially in the small river, yuck), there is a lot of dust and a lot of noise from the traffic on the main street and also no sidewalk, so you had to pay a lot of attention to the cars coming from both sides. So not really a place to walk relaxed in the evening.The service on the beach is terrible (with a few exceptions). Very slow waiters, you had to wait a lot for everything (menu, drinks, food, even the bill), they forget a lot from the orders and for some of them there is 10% percent service charge already included ( a service which is as I said terrible). But the service and the food is generally much better on the main street than on the beach (we found some places with really amazing food and very good service). So 4 stars for the beach itself, which is very beautiful, but not for the area surrounding the beach or the service on the beach.",2019/03/01,Blueberry2007,"Vienna, Austria"

I recommend this place must visit and also I recommend guide if you are interested something else than a view.,2019/02/27,Markyus,"Pori, Finland"

"Yes this is a must see. The highest mountain range in Sri Lanka with grand waterfalls and rivers, lakes and the supplier of half the worlds tea from the plants that surround these beautiful mountains. The homes with the beautiful vegetable gardens and terraced rice fields and misty mountain tops. Its absolutely breathtaking.",2019/02/27,Perry H,"San Diego, California"
"Did we do it? Yes, as we were never likely to be this way again.So it’s usually a 5 or 6am depart from Nuwara Eliya to get to the entry of the park for when it opens. The entry is about an hour away from Nuwara Eliya.However with a 5am departure time you will be driving in the dark. Better, for me, to have a later departure as the views on the way in are fabulous and, indeed, the best bit of the trip.Once there entry is expensive, indeed, I think it was the top price for entry we paid on our entire Sri Lankan trip. From the entry gates you then drive further into the park before the start of the walk. Once walking it’s a well marked, well worn track. We turned left at the first fork and went to Mini World’s End. This drops you into World’s End a little earlier than if you follow the main track. It’s an interesting walk on a sunny morning, no more. We did see the Bear Monkeys though, which was a highlight. The view from Worlds End is nice enough but for me, not as good as the one from Little Adams Peak.Baker Falls on the walk out are well worth a detour. The drive back to Nuwara Eliya is very pleasant - you’ll be home by lunchtime.",2019/02/27,Colin H,"Leicester, United Kingdom"
"Get here early if you want to see World’s End! I arrived at around 7.30am, got a picture of the hills with some cloud above them. Within minutes the whole hill and view were covered in thick cloud. I felt for those who arrived after me. The hike is reasonably rocky and wouldn’t be suitable for young children or anyone who isn’t fit. I completed the 9km in around two hours 40 with a few breaks and walked quite quickly. I completed it alone and didn’t need a guide. Everyone is friendly and I followed a few groups on the more tricky parts. Didn’t see any animals and only one interesting bird but the terrain is interesting and enjoyed the challenge.",2019/02/27,butclurr,"London, United Kingdom"
"Unfortunately Dehiwala beach is littered with garbage, fairly disgusting walking up and down the beach there.

Unfortunately it's the same way down so you are encountering people coming in the opposite direction and have to give way as the paths near the summit are narrow.

Well signposted route up to Little Adams Peak. Starts with a stroll through the tea plantations.

This was definitely the best walk we did in Sri Lanka. And it’s free.The start is just a short walk out of Ella itself and then it’s well signposted.

"The Temple of The Tooth, a UNESCO heritage site and one of the most visited places of the country, is the also one of the most sacred places for Buddhist around the world. The temple itself is an amazing, prestigious building which is surrounded by mountains, the lake and the hustling Citadelle of Kandy. There are thewawa timings where there will be ceremonial offerings done to the Sacred Tooth Relic, at the time the place will be a bit busy and throughout the day the place is filled with visitors. Highly recommended to wear long and white clothes that will cover your body given its religious values it is considered respectful to do so. There are few other shrines and temple with a museum that you can visit in the place and if you do have a local guide you may get a lot of historical information from them. Kandy is always full of tourist and there are many luxurious as well as affordable hotels and loggings available.

"We had an early morning start here to beat the crowds - and the weather. It was a wise move on behalf of our wonderful guide / chauffeur Sesath. I would not have wanted the stress of queues and press of people which was beginning to build as we left.It is not made clear in the guide books just how extensive the landscaping and gardens are in this fabulous site. The brickwork of the ponds and fountains of the formal gardens are is so extensive, and still being excavated. The site is huge, with the rock fortress on a seemingly vertical cliff overlooking it all. The famous frescoes are half way up to the first level, and as I am not good with heights, it was testing going up and then coming down the old metal spiral staircase. However, it was certainly worth it - a ‘must see’ - it helps to have a knowledgeable guide to tell you about them.Onwards to the lions paw platform, and look up at the daunting steps up the cliff face - I made sure I didn’t look down!The climb is worth it to marvel at the shear engineering challenge, as well as the fantastic view from the top.

"Only 26 km from Nuwara Eliya but a long, steep and winding drive up to the plains. Going up through Pattipola from Nuwara Eliya allows you to visit the Ambewela Farms and view the rolling farm countryside and dairy herds. Pattipola is also the highest point on the railway going to Ella and the road crosses the tracks at the station.It's best to get to Horton Plains early. Mist rolls in later in the morning and often the views are obscured. It's a 5 km hike to World's End and back via Baker's Falls, also worth seeing. Head back out of the park via the Ohiya road for some spectacular views of the World's End gap from the road. Not exactly the same as hiking to the lookout point but stunning nevertheless. Viewing wildlife is a hit or miss prospect. We saw nothing. But there are some tame Sambhur deer at the visitor center for a photo opportunity.

Quite a climb but not as scary as we’d been led to believe. Well worth it as the ruins at the top are extensive and the view is fabulous. But you need to get there early. On our way down at 10am the queues were horrendous. We heard one guide leading his tour up a back route and saying that the main queue would take four hours!

"A 600 feet tall steep rock jutting out of the earth. Difficult to avoid seeing it, no matter where you go. It is a magnificent view. 1500 years ago a king built his palace and fortress atop the rock! What a feat of engineering!! The huge paws are the evidence of the gorgeous stone lion at the top. The palace and the fortress are gone. Only the foundations remain. As does a large water tank (the king's swimming pool - the guide said) and the huge stone throne from where the king held court. Half way up, one can see some Ajanta style female frescoes on the rock face (Photography prohibited). There were 500, the guide said. All were the king's concubines, he confided.Seeing our 70 something frail frames, the guide was doubtful we could make it to the top. But was impressed when we made the round trip in less than two hours.A must visit place.",2019/02/24,mayday1942,"Ghaziabad, India"
"I got to the ticket office at 6.30am when it opened - it was a Saturday and there was still a group of us waiting even at that time. It does feel expensive compared to other tourist sites in Asia but if you've flown all this way...!After having your ticket checked, you walk through the gardens at the base of the rock. I didn't realise that you wouldn't go through this area again on the way down so just walked through to start the climb - so you have to decide between lingering a bit or just getting on with the climb. Overall I didn't find the ascent too strenuous - I think going later in the day when it's hotter and crowded would make the ascent feel more difficult than it actually is. There's not a whole lot to see at the top bar some fairly flat ruins but the view and sense of achievement makes it worth it! No sign of hornets when I went but there were a lot of flies at the top which made it difficult to sit and relax for too long. I started going down by 9am and it was getting busy - those climbing up were already at a standstill in places.Your ticket includes a visit to the museum which is small but a respite from the heat and had some interesting photos / displays about the history of the rock. If you plan it well - early morning, ideally avoiding weekends and holidays - I think it's enjoyable. Nearby Pidurangala is a cheaper option with great views but it's a very different experience and I think complements Lion Rock rather than replacing it.",2019/02/24,SJ88,"Sheffield, United Kingdom"

"The excitement of waking at dawn and going on safari was soon dispelled by the complete mayhem at the gate. Queues of trucks, mostly with 2/3 people on them. The problem could easily be solved by transferring people onto fewer trucks. Soon after we entered the park elephant were spotted and we were quietly sitting watching this beautiful site when another truck/jeep of very loud Chinese pulled right in front blocking our view entirely. Not only that but we then couldn't move until they did. However, once our guide got us away from the main drag we saw plenty of wildlife. The highlight was actually the beach where there is a memorial to those who died in the Tsunami. Tranquil, beautiful and not a single human in sight. The park is victim of its success. There need to be far fewer trucks, more cooperation between the drivers as to things they've seen, etc (it seems they all passed in a hurry not mentioning the herd of elephant we'd just seen - Looking for biggest tips... who knows?

We accessed the peak from 98 Acres hotel on whose grounds the peak is situated. This meant we arrived away from the crowds and more touristy entrance. The hotel grounds are spectacular too. The peak itself was very crowded when we arrived so we walked much further down where it was quieter and the views of Ella rock and the surrounding area even more beautiful.

"This temple is a waste of time and money to go to. They charge tourists 1500 rupees to enter per person whilst locals get in for free. Guards at the door are extremely rude and did not let me in the first time as my attire was not to standard, although I saw many other women entering wearing similar clothing. Spent about 40 minutes queuing up for the “entrance” only for my partner and myself to be pushed and shoved multiple times by local women from the back although we had no where to move in front of us. The “entrance” sign ended up leading to a walkway to view the tooth relic, however, that was not made clear and we could only see into the tooth relic corridor for a maximum of 5 seconds before being shoved again by the locals from the Back. For the price paid, you would expect to have seen a lot more displays or have had a local que established to see the tooth relic for more than 5 seconds. The experience was a waste of money, not to mention there were men out of the front of the temple offering to sell us illegal substances right in front of police, looked like a corrupt scam to me.",2019/02/24,Jessica Q,

"Had a lovely morning strolling round the temple of the tooth. Places to leave your shoes were convenient, right next to the shrine itself, though if coming in from the Hindu temples entrance you may want to take them with you. We found the museum interesting and enjoyed reading the stories and seeing the artefacts. The shrine itself was lovely and we managed to see a ceremony (think it is 3times daily). Beautiful carvings and paintings. We were there early morning and left before it got busy at 10am. Could have had more information to assist with navigation.",2019/02/24,JMRS33,Scotland

Lord Buddha' tooth relic is kept in the erstwhile King's Palace. We reached in the evening at the time of worship & the crowd was huge with lots of pushing & jostling. Otherwise a good experience.,2019/02/24,samirsaran81,"Lucknow, India"
"My husband was not allowed in despite wearing long shorts. Others wore shorts with walking gaiters, or sarongs which covered much less and were allowed in. Many temples around the world they have a bin of old bits of material you can borrow for a donation but not here. Also the mausoleums to the left of the temple has the same problem. Go prepared. The other thing was, I deposited my shoes by the entrance only to find the ticket kiosk was all the way round the other side. After walking in bare feet over 200 meters on dark tiles my feet were killing me. Lesson 2 wear trainer socks because even inside certain areas are almost unbearable to walk in bare feet. Even the locals were having problems. Enough said on the practicalities, the temple is beautiful and definitely the highlight of Kandy!",2019/02/24,Ruth C,"Aylesbury, United Kingdom"

"Absolutely stunning and a great morning hike. Assuming average fitness, if you’ve done hikes before, and if there isn’t a throng of tourists ahead of you, then it should take about 45 minutes to reach the top.We got here early, about 20 mins before the ticket counters opened and were second in line for tickets. We paid in USD though you can pay in local currency too. The price was marginally better in USD and I understand they're quick to revise the local LKR rate when the local currency weakens too much.After getting the tickets, it’s a short 5 minute walk to the main entrance. We were the first to head up to the top which was nice in terms of taking unobstructed pictures, but I would not recommend it. There were too many stray dogs and being the first to climb up the dogs follow you every step of the way. The dogs stink pretty bad, and are very aggressive at times as if they’re going to bite you. I was thinking at multiple times that we would get bitten and have to turn back. We didn’t get bitten, but I’m not sure that no one has ever not been attacked, and it certainly is not worth the stress. I think, let maybe 10-15 people go ahead of you first! Either that, or bring dog food to feed them. So many times I wished I had food to throw and get them away from us.",2019/02/23,jbm4075,"Las Vegas, Nevada"
"Firstly, don't pay through the nose at your hotel/guest house. Go to the forest entrance and ask for a guide, we went the evening before and arranged a guide for 2000Rps which on the day became 3000Rps (£13 or $17) for a 5 hour walk for 2 people. But still better than $35 per person from the hotel. You'll still have to pay the 575Rps entrance either way.Secondly DO wear leachproof socks. I got bitten on the path walking to a restaurant near the forest wearing sandals. 'its too dry, there are no leeches...' many said this. The bleeding lasted 2 days. Wear the socks, don't be put off, it's worth it.You'll not go deep into the forest, the first part of any walk is along the path shared by locals, motorcycles and many many dogs. On the longer walks you go in a bit deeper but not far as it's necessary to protect primary rainforest like this.You will see: snakes, spiders, monkeys, giant squirrels, and lots of lizards. They will be pointed out to you and I believe will be in the same place day after day. You may see birds, but you will hear them and waterfalls.Wear walking boots or shoes, take plenty to drink and some snacks. Don't expect the full jungle experience, it's a nice walk on the edge of a pristine environment. Best it stays that way.",2019/02/23,Mikethecoach,"Sevenoaks, United Kingdom"

"A truly disappointing experience for our first ever safari.We stayed at Leopard Trails Camp just outside the national park which was not cheap. From our camp it was 20 minutes to the gate of the national park. From the gate, it was probably another 15 mins of basically just bushes on either side.From there, the view was mainly of dirt roads, the occasional elephant, and many different types of birds. The pain of being in a bumpy vehicle versus what we saw on the dirt roads was not worth it at all. The pain of being thrown around the vehicle is not to be underestimated - I hated it worse than doing a spinning class. It was also terribly annoying how our guide tried to make every sighting of a bird as a big thing.Adding in the cost of staying at one of the better camps, this adventure was not worth it at all. I don’t think I would even recommend it at half the price. Skip Yala and enjoy the other beautiful sights of Sri Lanka instead.We spoke to seasoned safari visitors back at camp. They said African safaris are way better. If African safaris were a 10, this like a 2.",2019/02/23,jbm4075,"Las Vegas, Nevada"

"Kandy is a large city in Sri Lanka. It's set on a plateau surrounded by beautiful mountains. The city's heart you will find a beautiful scenic Lake (Bogambara Lake), where the famous Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic is cited. Our visit was an incredibly long drive through mountainous roads and towns, the view is incredible and when you arrive into Kandy it is totally a wow factor. Arriving at the Temple you need to cover your sholders and knees (I purchased a sarong) from the locals for 1000 SR rupees. We entered the grounds with a Catholic Church, Hindu Temple before arriving at the Buddhist Temple in its full glory. It is so worth hiring a guide for this experience, you receive so much more knowledge and insights. The beauty and grace of the Temple is majestic which the 128 gold lotus flowers in the ceiling, beautiful flowers, prayer and special energy this temple represents. If you are visiting Kandy you must visit the temple, a part from the history that this temple experienced you really get to see and experience so much, I wish we had seen the special Kandy procession, but unfortunately we travelled on the wrong day. A really worthwhile visit to a very special place.",2019/02/23,cartier10,"London, United Kingdom"
"This is a huge complex and is much bigger than I initially thought when driving by. I had expected to find a small temple but ended up spending about an hour here. It was nice to come early in the morning around 8am as we mostly avoided the crowds.The ticket counter for tourists is on the right side. There will be ‘official’ guides hanging around the ticket counter. Don’t feel pressured into agreeing to a tour. We ended getting one, but I’m two minds about whether it was worth it or not. Not in terms of the price, it cost LKR 1,000 (about 5 USD), but in that it was kind of annoying to have someone follow you around, and you had to listen to him finish speaking about something before moving on (I guess he wants to give you your money’s worth). Oh, if you do want to get a guide, don’t pay more than LKR 1,000 – I heard later on that you sometimes get charged more depending on your nationality.The elephant room was nice, what a sad life for those elephants.I’m surprised no one has mentioned this in past reviews but bring an extra pair of socks to change into as you'll need to take off your shoes. You can keep your socks on, and they will get pretty filthy. We were glad to change into new socks before putting our shoes back on.",2019/02/23,jbm4075,"Las Vegas, Nevada"

"Visited Horton Plains and hiked two different trails for a total of 12 kilometers. The first (and most scenic) was a circuit trail called World’s End, extending from the park entrance to Baker’s Falls: a 20 meter water fall at the midway point. The Horton Plains trails follow a plateau route that is 2100 to 2300 meters in altitude. At most, expect a 150 meter elevation gain over the length of the route. Scenes are spectacular: you’ll pass so many beautiful vistas and scenic overlooks that you’ll run out of smartphone battery power before running out of photos to take.

Only when you arrive at the zip line centre do you have to exert effort to ascend well made concrete steps for about 20 minutes. Be sure to have at least 2 litres of water with you.

Luckily we had our guide with us or we wouldn’t have had a clue what we were looking at, or where to go next. A stunning temple that’s definitely worth a visit.

I took a guide (2000 rupees +500 tip) and this was worth it, I learnt a lot. Unbelievably some people were taking very young children to the top - that is just stupid, it’s too hot and the steps are to high in places.

We visited the museum first and this gave us a great insight into the history of the site, the only thing was that we were followed round by a security guard for most of this which made me feel as if we were somewhere that we were not meant to be.

Lots of places to eat on the beach, some very good. Jet ski hire, body board hire, wake boarding and plenty of people wanting you to go whale watching or snorkling. The sea can get quite rough with big waves. Not a beach I would say for children unless they are confident in the water . Either side of the beach people are surfing. Unfortunately our hotel was very close to the beach and there was loud music until the early hours. So again if you are young (or old) and that is what you want, then go for it. There was hardly anywhere to souvenir shop only a few tiny shops which did not want to barter, fixed price. To buy alcohol you had to visit the store opposite the Cargills supermarket.

Beautiful building not to be missed",2019/02/20,sueruffell364,"London, United Kingdom"
Most beautiful temple and must be included in your visit to Kandy. The sacred tooth of Buddah memorial is stunning and dont miss the museum and history of Buddhism.,2019/02/20,Clive L,"Meppershall, United Kingdom"
"Temple is very beautiful. Fortunately we visited temple on fullmoon day. 
World of Buddhism museum is good.",2019/02/20,PadmasenB,
If you visit one Temple in Sri Lanka this is the one. Awe inspiring and atmospheric as you pass the sacred golden casket of the holy relic with the devout Buddhist visitors waiting and praying patiently for the exposition . Wonderful venue.,2019/02/20,LechladeGerry,
"Arrived here for 2 weeks at the beginning of Feb 2019.We found the beach nice and when calm it’s lovely to go in the sea but be careful the waves can get really big a strong! Losing your bikini haha! It wasn’t the most friendly of places but as everywhere has a 10% service charge added to the bill, they’ve no need to be pleasant or rush to get you drinks (that are warm within 5 minutes) as they’ve already got your tip without putting any effort in.The food was all for ‘westerners’ such as, chips, burgers, crispy chicken, flavourless rice & noodles...chicken curry came in huge portions so would need to share and ask if you want it spicy or it won’t be at all.Then long waits for meals that when eventually come are more times than not came out cold. If you want a sunbed at a particular shack you’ll need to get there about 8 am.Very touristy yet beautiful looking out to the ocean from the beach. We stood on the corner of the beach where loads of people were in the water taking pics and splashing around a turtle, this seemed cruel so we carried on walking.We then move to Mirissa- 1 1/2 hours in taxi.",2019/02/19,Indiboo5,"Wakefield, United Kingdom"
We visited the Lion Rock early one morning to beat the crowds. The site is very impressive and is an amazing place to visit. The climb to the top takes a few steps but its well worth it. You will no doubt be amazed as to how they managed to build everything on the top! The only down side for us was that it satrted raining half way up so the views from the top were zero,2019/02/19,David B,"Cardiff, United Kingdom"
We had been warned to go early but didn’t want to go at the recommended time or the teens would moan. So we arrived at about 9.30am and the site was quite busy. It was hot but the humidity was the real challenge. There were sections where we had to queue but to be honest I didn’t mind as it meant we climbed at an even tempo (rather than me trying to keep up with the kids) which made it much more so-able. Bring as much cold water as you can carry as you won’t be able to buy any until you get back down. A cold flannel (or just one to wipe up the sweat) would have been helpful as would a hand held fan. The frescos are worth the nail biting climb up the spiral staircase if you can and the views at the top is amazing. The steps are all sorts of depths and materials and rarely have any type of handrail. I’m not fit but I’m able bodied and I think that is a pre-requisite. Anyone with a bad knee or ankle might struggle to get up but almost certainly to get back down.,2019/02/19,Townriders,
Take time to explore the gardens before attempting the climb. The climb up the stairs is hard work but the views from the top are magnificent. Because you are so busy watching your step going up it is easy to forget to look up and appreciate the scenery. The stairs arecquitw narrow at times but slow and steady will get you there. Wear walking shoes and take water to drink on the way.,2019/02/19,Johnadh,"Dalyan, Turkey"
We went 7:30 and even then there were many people going up however we enjoyed the climb but when coming down around 10 que was all the way to the bottom and it would have taken 2-3 hours just to climb up. Get up early and enjoy the rock.,2019/02/19,garylamba,"Melbourne, Australia"
It is quite a climb to the top so if you don’t want to climb in the heat of the day get there early. If you really don’t like heights think about this carefully. It’s fine going up but coming down you have no choice but to look down for feet placement. The views from the top are wonderful and you will see plenty of monkeys! Well worth a visit.,2019/02/19,T6171DUians,
"We entered the national park close to Deniyaya. We had a guide called Saman and paid about 50€ for the two of us. The tour took about 5 hours and one other couple was attend as well. Pretty sure you can negotiate a little better price, but compared to other activities in SL this was a good price! :) Can recommend Saman, might also be cheaper if you call him directly, without paying your hotel a commission: +94415635255 Saman collected us at our BnB which was about 5km away from the actual entrance with his tuktuk and his english is good enough to explain everything inside the forest and reply to all regarding questions.",2019/02/19,malagoda,
"Arrived well before sunrise to join a long queue. Hard to believe that on the day before Independence Day there was only one person selling tickets.

"This beach is located close to Colombo. It’s very active and not super peaceful. The tides are also really strong. A man was retrieved from the water with few people in his family noticing his absent. I didn’t stick around to see if they were able to resuscitate him. I’d be weary about having the elderly children, or anyone for that matter playing in these waters. I visited this beach after spending time in Hikkaduwa, Mirissa and Hiriketiya. The pollution, caused by the crowds really takes away from the beach. In retrospect, I should have spent two hours to make it back to Hikkaduwa. Watch the sunset here and drink a beer.",2019/02/19,angelad660,
Wanting to avoid the crowds of Sigiriya we headed to this alternative. Climb not that difficult leading to fabulous views (including if one wishes of the hordes at Lion Rock). Got to the top c0830 and no more than a dozen others present.,2019/02/19,Robinhbishop,"Hertford, United Kingdom"

"This was a fantastic beach full of tourists, sun loungers and parasols. Plenty of bars and restaurants. Also surfing for beginners and an added break for experienced surfers at the eastern end. Sadly, this is not the beach for us. Jet Skis in the sea and a seriously busy road that runs the length of the beach. Far too much noise! The restaurants and bars were characterless too. We much preferred the amenities at Weligama Beach but both were eclypsed by Polhena. At Polhena, you're away from the road, it's a reef so there's no jet skis, you can swim with turtles and just down the road is Madiha; proper surf! My advice is to stay in Polhena and take a day trip to Mirissa.",2019/02/19,Keith W,"Corwen, United Kingdom"
"The beach is clean and the sea very warm (didn’t risk the big waves but lovely when calm). Hardly any sunbeds but you can pay them...we prefer to find a nice shack, chill and eat & drink there all day but here you have to pay for food and drinks up front rather that waiting until the end of the day...no trust maybe?!?! The staff already have a 10% service charge so no effort is put in to make you feel welcome or valued. I know we shouldn’t compare but going to South Goa (Agonda) was a 10/10 experience for food, service and friendliness. We don’t travel all that way to eat western food like chips, burgers, pizza, or bland noodles. We won’t be back",2019/02/19,Indiboo5,"Wakefield, United Kingdom"

"Unlike other beaches, this one was relatively clean. Also, there is a spot by the coast guard station where there are trees you can hang out under full shade. I spent many days stretching out on the hammock that I brought with me to Sri Lanka. Not to mention it was a beautiful beach well trodden by international hotties.",2019/02/19,Kevin K,
We visited in the evening when the monks came out to receive food and gifts as our guide said this was a must see. Its a beautiful place but very crowded at this time so we didn't get to see as much of the building as we had hoped. I would suggest going at a different time in the day if you do not want to witness the ceremony.,2019/02/19,David B,"Cardiff, United Kingdom"
Not sure visiting here was up to much. Too crowded. Locals venerate the place understandably and I wasn’t comfortable being a camera toting tourist with no spiritual link adding to the congestion. Really not much to see and the pressing thong wasn’t great. I’d rather I’d given it a miss actually.,2019/02/19,Count_colin,"London, United Kingdom"

Away from park lots - inside museum building is ticket counter which you have to line for very long waiting just to pay 30$ for single visit.

"In my opinion.We found the entrance fee a little too steep $30 (5500). We have visited many tourist attractions here in Sri Lanka and entrance costs vary from 250 to 1500 rupees. Climbing the step over an overcrowded experience and more like a cattle farm. There is a metal spiral staircase attached to the cliff side, so no good for the faint hearted.On the summit there are ruins and views of tree tops only.Personally I felt it was overpriced and after this experience we kept away from entrance charges in excess of 2000 rupees.",2019/02/18,Urbantourist1,Cyprus
"I have a fear of heights and so was a little concerned. Our guide said that I could get a hand up if I needed. Well I did it on my own. It is a very slow pace due to all the people. Hundreds of people. But they have it well layer out and things move very smoothly. Lots of places to hold onto. So worth it when you get to the top. The views are amazing. For me getting to the top was my highlight. There were very old as well as very young children. Beware not to take any food as you encounter many monkeys. Wear a hat and take water, you will be totally drenched from sweat.",2019/02/18,Happysoulalways,"Cranbrook, Canada"
"Absolutely stunning view on the top. It is a hard climb so be prepared for that. 

A good advice is to be there early before the man rush starts. We were there at 8.00 am in the morning which was very good.",2019/02/18,mvalentin90,"Frederiksberg, Denmark"
"We were nervous about climbing Sigiriya Rock. Neither of us are a fan of heights and the sound of 1200 steps didn’t exactly appeal.But we did it and we’re so happy we did, the view from the top is nothing short of spectacular. Estimates of a 2-2.5 hour climb to the top and back again are wildly exaggerated, even at a slow pace. We didn’t do the section with the spiral staircase that led to some caves with ancient paintings in them. The enclosed stairs looked pretty claustrophobic. But you can just bypass them. It took us about an hour and a half up and down including 30 mins admiring the spectacular view. We also had a drink break at the lions paws. In truth your pace will dictated by the people in front of you, because there’s no way to pass them. We felt the section of stairs up to the lions paw gateway were worse than the last section. Incidentally when you get to the lion paws you’re more than half way there. Yes, you’ll see monkeys on the way up, but if you don’t wave food in their faces they’ll totally ignore you. Don’t let anyone touch or hold on to you claiming they work there and they’re helping you. Unless of course you’re happy to pay them for this service. I found the man who claimed he was helping me made things a lot worse. I didn’t ask for help so I told him politely to stop it and he disappeared instantly. Anyway, overall the climb was nowhere near as bad as we thought, it felt quite safe and there were much older less able people climbing it than us. Even at quite a slow pace it didn’t take anywhere near as long as we were lead to believe, this really is a must do. You’ll only regret it if you don’t.Iain, London",2019/02/18,Iain73,"London, United Kingdom"

Didn’t know what to expect but came to Kandy just to see this attraction as it was a must see in Sri Lanka. Nice temple and lots to see and experience in relation to a lot of temples I’ve been to in the past.Not at all religious but was an experience and the crowds that literally pack in to see where the Tooth relic is stored is unbelievable.,2019/02/18,stefan1001,"London, United Kingdom"
What a treasure and not far to travel though traffic is pretty abysmal as it's a busy town.

"We visited on a very hot morning and the crowds and heat almost put us off more than a cursory stroll around. We met Sam, by chance, who offered to guide us, having given us a lift into town earlier ( no charge, just heading down the same hill). He, as a believer, made the whole experience very special for us, making sure no faux pas were committed and rituals and observations were adhered to. He then took us to some of the other places on our hit list in Kandy, arranged our tickets for the dance performance in the evening and generally looked after us very well indeed. At our request, he took us to the railway station in the morning and made sure we got the right tickets and were waiting on the right platform. He was great company and left it to us to pay whatever we felt was fair for his services, this guy will not rip you off!

"We made the trip to the summit of Lion Rock under the wise recommendation of our guide to start as soon as the attraction opened and before the heat of the sun was up.There are apparently 1202 steps to the top but for sure there are many and getting to the top is no mean feast as we get older. Many of the stone steps are uneven and due to prolonged use are worn therefore careful and gradual accent is key to your safety. Part way up you encounter a steel spiral staircase that takes you up to the frescos viewing platform. If you don't like heights this part of the accent can be un-nerving. There is a large area where the Lion's feet are located where you can take a rest under tree shade before the final accent. There are a number of signs referring to wasps and we understand if these are disturbed this can be the reason to prevent further accents.Having reached the summit the citidel ruins are interesting and the views are great thereforethis attraction is a must see for photographers.The journey down is obviously quicker and eventually takes a separate route from the accent steps. Care must still be taken on the worn steps. At the bottom you run the gauntlet of local stalls selling souveniers as you follow the one way path to the ""foreigners car park"". Still they are not hard sell and a firm ""no thank you"" worked OK.Summary: A physical effort to reach the summit but the views are worth it. Do yourself a favour and go early morning to avoid the baking sun on the climb up.",2019/02/17,239philw,"Greater Manchester, United Kingdom"
"We tried to go visit. The enterance fee is £45 per person. It has 375 steps and is very steep to get to the top. Although if you can not go up and only get to the half way you should be able to see the feet of lion. I have back pain issues, although I was aware of the steps, i did not know how steep they were. I could not go up much and had to get back. It is probably my own lack of information but it seemed wasted",2019/02/17,318zarai,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom"
A must see! Before you begin the ascent you pass through the gardens - one side has been archaeologically excavated and the other not. Interesting to see what a project the excavation would have been and the layout is beautiful. The climb is lots and lots of steps (no boulder clambering!) but do go early doors before the temperature rises and before the tour bus crowds build making for an extremely slow ascent. The views from the summit are truly amazing,2019/02/17,Baz_the_barn,"Milton Keynes, United Kingdom"

You also need to be quite fit for the walk as a lot of it is over rocky ground wear really supportive shoes four of us are 60+ and managed ok.

"Its not a wildlife experience, its more of a rally dakar, between all the jeeps. Starting already lined up right before the gates open at 6 am it was already a race just till the entrance gate to figure out who will have the pole position.Its a fact that we saw leopards at the end of a full day safari which cost us LKR 8000,- per person. But it wasnt worth it. The poor animals are when spotted, disturbed by 150 sometimes more really loud Jeeps. Drivers communicate by howling their engines to make a pass and so on... a hughe elephant family fled from us bcs the 25 cars infont f them wehere fighting for a good spot for their tourist to get a better picture. I feel ashamed that i sponsored this behaviour by paying for the safari. If u love animals, realllyDONT do it.its not a bit relaxing nor pleasant. Full day tour includes a lunch and a 2hrs break of which we had not been informed before. So make sure u bring a book, or a least some blanket, towel etc so u can chill under a tree(outside the wildlifepark) or the near beach. But its from midday till 2 pm so u dont want to stay in the sun. Just for seeing a leopard from a far it was not at all worth spending 12 hrs in a jeep, u will need a spa after that. Best outfit: sunglasses (because of the debris and dust from the cars infront of you), clothes u dont care much about (red sand), flipflops, sunblocker. Dont forget to tell your hotel to give u a breakfast to go, since they ll pick u up at about 4:30 am to go there. The lunch was really great and nice though.

It’s a beautiful beach and the perfect place to head for dinner and drinks when the sun goes down and the candles all get lit at the tables at the various eateries along the beach. There are still a lot of open beach spaces so it’s not packed with tables and loungers, just the right balance. We based ourselves in mirissa for our 3 days on the south coast so we could eat and enjoy the evening life in mirissa and then just caught tuktuk to weligama for the day to surf.

"We visited this temple with a state certified guide and so glad we did. The temple was packed with locals and pilgrims during a local festival all wanting to parade across the doorway to the sacred relic and make offerings. It was absolutely fascinating to witness the ceremony and people making offerings and because of our guide we were not made to feel to be intruding. The door to the room that holds the relic opens for about 5 mins in each hour and because of our guide we were just in the right place to see inside and witness the whole thing. The temple complex holds a number of different temples, image rooms, monks quarters and there is so much to see. This is difficult when the temple is so busy but in the end it is a real live working temple and hence the trade off to witness what we did was worthwhile. This is a must-see attraction for visitors to Sri Lanka but make sure you go with a guide to get the most from it.",2019/02/17,239philw,"Greater Manchester, United Kingdom"
"Sri Lanka is a Buddhist country and this temple is the centre of the religion. If you are anywhere near Kandy it's a ' must visit' sort of place, even if you have no interest in Buddhism.

Supposedly housing one of Buddha's teeth this obviously has a special significance for Buddhists. But it's all a bit underwhelming for non-believers.

Wonderful sacred temple best visited in the evening as it is beautifully lit with lights and candles. Drummers drum throughout the evening while pilgrims make their way with their offerings to see the golden stupa housing the tooth behind a wooden door which opens at intervals allowing a quick peek inside. The crowds grow large inside waiting for the doors to open but it is worth the wait to see inside before you are ushered on. It is warm inside too but a must if you are traveling through this area.,2019/02/17,lauraduggan2015,"Austin, Texas"
"The temple is housed within the complex of the royal palace which is a very appealing and historic area. After passing through security into the palace grounds you need to make your way to the temple and the foreigner’s ticket office which are a bank of automatic ticket machines. Entry is 1500 rupees per person, cash only and no change given. Upon entry into the temple you first pass into the main shrine which is a wonderful and ornamental historic building on two levels. Behind this is the chamber where the tooth relic is stored which, again, is a wonderfully decorative room with a huge collection of buddha statues and banners telling the history of the tooth. At one end is the shrine with the tooth casket. Your entry ticket also provides access to a museum behind the tooth chamber. You also have access to the palace grounds.The temple is a lovely old historic building but a visit doesn’t actually take all that long to be fair.",2019/02/17,Dakles,"Southampton, United Kingdom"

This is a must do if you visit Sri Lanka. Don’t forget to go on a day that it’s not raining. The place will offer you a 360-degrees superb view. The forest looks endless from the top. Remarkable. Make sure you bring some hat and a bottle of water with you during your trip.,2019/02/16,Tan781,
"Well, expect long lines. Expect to meet lots of locals, especially in the weekends. And expect a long steep walk. But arriving at the top, you just feel amazed. The view, if nothing else.

"We visited on a public holiday and the numbers ascending the rock were ludicrous. We shuffled our way up so slowly that it took over 2 hours to reach the top. I would happily have bailed out after 30 minutes but there was no way back through the crowds as you ascend and descend on different routes.The views from the top were good and the historical site was of interest but there was minimal signage to provide some detail of what you were looking at - I guess we should have hired a guide. There was a Red Cross hut on the top but no other facilities. Indeed the only toilets were at the start by the ticket office.We had to queue for 30 minutes to start the descent and then an hour of torrential rain started. We were absolutely soaked by the end as there was no cover anywhere from the rain. I felt for the masses still ascending who had no option but to continue and get drenched as there was no turning back!30 US dollars is a crazy sum for this attraction (locals pay less than one dollar). If you want the views, and not the history, then I suggest the sister rock of similar height about a mile away where there were plenty of people but no queues - I assume it is free but I don't know for sure.",2019/02/16,AlanJames52,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom"
"Visiting the citadel of Sigiriya has been one of my longstanding dreams since 1982 when for the first time I listened to ""Save a prayer"" by Duran Duran and watched the related video. Now it is not anymore as meanwhile my dream has finally become true. I fully enjoyed my visit to Sigiriya even though I was a bit disappointed as I wasn't allowed to take pictures of the beautiful frescoes painted on a section of the rocky side of the fortress.Needless of me to say climbing up to the top is really grueling but it is an unforgettable experience. In order to admire the fortress at its best there is also the possibility to go on top of Pidurangala hill which is one km far away from the fortress. It is generally suggested climbing on the top at sunset time to fully enjoy the view of the fortress. However climbing to the top of Pidurangala is not that easy. Being in a good shape is necessary. The final part of the rock climbing is pretty tough and a rope is needed (you can find the rope on the place). Since at some point there are no signs, if you want to go to Pidurangala you need to walk until you arrive at a temple which is on your right and then you have to enter the temple before starting your climb. Good luck!",2019/02/16,Daniele-Donati,"Florence, Italy"
"This was our first stop on our Sri Lanka trip and what a way to start. It boggles the mind to think that people built anything on top of this magnificent rock formation, let alone about 2000 years ago for the monastery and then later for the fortress. It costs about 30 US dollars for the entry ticket. It's not an especially tough climb but I was pretty nervous on some of the steeper staircases. Most of the ascent is metal staircases attached to the side of the sheer rock face. There can be queues at the narrower parts and particularly close to the entrance of the caves where you can see cave wall paintings. Don't have any snacks on the way up or you will attract the attention of the monkeys!",2019/02/16,paulmS2599AO,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates"
"Everything about this site is breathtaking. The natural wonder of the rock itself, the paintings and the ruins. One of those great experiences you just feel so lucky to have had.The climb itself is a bit of a challenge in the heat, but the experience at the top worth the effort.

"Great beach (the best we've seen in Sri Lanka, out of 4 or 5) IF: 1) you don't want bars and annoying vendors on the beach, 2) you don't like crowds, 3) you like fine-grained sand and a clean beach, 4) especially, if you like swimming – not wading, but really swimming. There is a rock between the bay and the sea, it's about 900 meters from the beach, so it's a great swim. When the sea is calm, you can swim very near the rock and see all kinds of fish (not much of coral reef, though, and whatever there is is dead). When the sea is not so calm, be very careful – I stayed at least 10–20 meters away from the nearest visible rock, and I could still see some rocks beneath me. The downsides: 1) The sea is very opaque (cloudy) – you can't see further than 1 meter, perhaps a little more. This is because of the very fine sand floating in the sea (near the beach) and, above all, because of microscopic algae making the water green. 2) On the way from the beach to the rock, there is an area where somewhat dirty-looking foam gathers – you might want to swim around it. 3) Of course, as transpires from the above, if you like beach partying, this is not a beach for you. 4) The waves can be strong, so I am not sure it's a good beach for small kids.",2019/02/16,Aaadaaam,"Warsaw, Poland"

The first part of the walk is through attractive tea plantations, following that Sri Lanka's biggest, fastest, highest etc zip wire ride comes into view (30 dollars from memory). The busy climb continues with magnificent views all around.The sense of achievement at reaching the peaks is somewhat tempered when you see others who have also made it in bare feet, carrying babies etc! On the way down you can get your photo taken with a local tea planter - but don't forget to tip her!After 2 hours of moderate exhaustion and heat we stopped at the first bar we saw (we were actually staying overnight there) and had the most wonderful juice drink I have ever enjoyed (the venue is called Chill Out).",2019/02/16,AlanJames52,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom"

We found it a little uncomfortable following the crowds through halls where people were praying and meditating, but no one seemed to mind. The actual room where the golden tooth is housed is only open at certain times which is early morning or after 6.30pm. We were warned that bother men and women need long trousers and to have proper tshirts/ shirts that cover the shoulders. The people that were wearing shorts or had short skirts had to buy sarongs to cover their lower legs.A really pleasant experience.",2019/02/16,KTRutland,"Rutland, United Kingdom"

The reason why I decided to visit Gangaramaya temple is because I am very interested in Buddhism. Aside from that this temple is regarded as the most important in town. However to my surprise I have realized there are two Gangaramaya temples...let's say the old one and the new one. They are very close to each other but the latter has been built on a city lake. It is almost done but there are still works in progress. The entrance ticket costs 300 rupees. Once I arrived there by chance I asked at the entrance if that was Gangaramaya temple and I was told yes. After my visit I was kinda confused as what I saw didn't match the pictures I saw on the Internet. This is why I asked a passerby where Gangaramaya temple was. He told me the real temple is not the one on the lake but 200 or 300 meters from the new one. The entrance fee for the real Gangaramaya temple is still 300 hundred rupees. With a total of 600 rupees you can visit the both of them. Also in the old temple there are works in progress at the time of my writing. However you can pleasantly enjoy both the new and the old temple.,2019/02/16,Daniele-Donati,"Florence, Italy"

The climb up the rock and back down will take from 1.5 hours to 3 hours. I suggest arriving early in the morning and climbing as soon as possible as it gets busier as the day goes on.

I visited with my wife (both 27) last week. We were both very disappointed with what is a fairly basic temple and was absolutely rammed full of locals and tourists. The temple is medium sized and not massively elaborate except for the few shrines. It may have meaning to Buddhists but it is not much of a spectacle for tourists. It was also rammed full of locals and tourists so moving around was slow.

"We were so excited about Yala and couldn’t wait for our ‘half day’ safari trip. We woke up at 5.30am, all excited, trundled down the road for 45 minutes until we reached the gates. We had to wait with the 100 other jeeps at the entrance for a good half an hour, then once everyone has their tickets and the gates open it’s a mad race to get in. We didn’t see a huge variety of wildlife - mostly things we’d seen before just on the side of the road. No elephants at all, but a few birds, crocodiles and a blink-and-you-miss-it glimpse of a distant leopard. The whole experience was more like a zoo and there is no control over smelly, noisy jeeps smashing their way in and around the park. If there’s a glimpse of something special, the guides are all phoned and you end up in a traffic jam of 10-20 vehicles crowding around the poor (leopard, sloth bear... etc). We were told there had been a black bear sighting nearby, but we had the view of jeeps instead, with guides shouting and roaring engines as the ambience. I feel sorry for the life in the park, I’d rather these parks shut their gates for good than terrorise the life in them any further. We were also told we had a half day safari but we were done in 2 hours. What I thought was the half way point, was actually the place where we turned around and we began to trundle towards the exit. I was surprised to see the gates so soon after we’d started. I had a quick look at my phone map and it looked as though we had skirted along the coast with every other tourist under the sun and not actually gone into the park much at all.

"The temple is amazing, so much to see. Unlike all the other ruined temples we visited this one really gave us a feel for the culture and religion of Sri Lanka. Our Guide Chamila (Onyk Lanka Tours) was so knowledgeable and really helpful. He bought us flowers at the entrance so that we coud give them to Buddha and ask for his blessing and support. We were totally immersed in the experience.",2019/02/14,Jackie A,"Kingston, United Kingdom"

"We attended the temple in September 2018 as part of a 2 day tour organised by Sam Sampath, Big Brother Tours. This was undeniably a must see temple, but our timing could have been better. The weekend we arrived coincided with one of the biggest Buddhist Festivals and the temple was very congested. That apart, I can't imagine coming all the way to Sri Lanka and not coming here.A great experience.",2019/02/14,raymondmacc2015,"Renfrewshire, United Kingdom"
I think this is the most important buddhist temple in Srilanka. We went there just before the sunset and there was a ritual about to start. It is interesting to see and experience a religious ceremony you don't know about. On the other hand the temple is congested with tourists and locals. Visiting is a must.,2019/02/14,Bark T,"Istanbul, Turkey"

We explored the citadel on the top, and we also enjoyed the grounds and smaller trails and caves around the area.

"We climbed with a guided tour and went early in the morning. It seemed busy to us on the way up, but coming down the lines were huge. It is a hard climb, but the view is amazing and there is alot to spend time looking at at the top. It does help having a guide as it is far more interesting if you can hear historical facts and information. Take it slowly, enjoy all of it and absorb the history. Most cultures do not not have the opportunity to share this kind of history, so respect all of what is on offer here.",2019/02/13,Lizbunty,"Melbourne, Australia"
"Well where do I begin? Just do it! Don't be put off by the climb, I won't say it's easy but tiny children do it. We met an elderly lady who was advised not to do it, her friend went up instead and now she regrets listening to the advice! It is a real once in a lifetime experience. Astounding to imagine how it was built! Side note- people complain that foreigners pay more than locals, and for me it's not only reasonable but absolutely the right thing to do. In a nation where the average person earns less than £2 a day, don't begrudge paying a little extra for things you can easily afford. Spread the wealth!",2019/02/13,weeny1979,"Glasgow, Scotland"

It is a bit exspensive 5500R however something to do while in Dambulla and there were some nice views at the top.

This is a temple where you have to cover up. There are frescos at the entrance depicting the huge annual street celebration parade which includes elephants & many people. There is not a lot to see where the relic is located, however at the rear of the temple there are many large frecos depicting Buddha's life which is well worth a look.

We were taken in the evening by our guide as you have to remove your shoes to enter and if would have been too hot to walk on the ground in the day time. A beautiful large temple, filled with Buddhas and gold and colour. And of course, the famous tooth relic. Lovely to see it lit up at night and to see the candles lit all together. Seemed a bit chaotic around the tooth and I felt sorry for the locals who had just come to pray and we’re seated facing the tooth, with foreigners and tourists trampling all over them. So fascinating to learn about the origins of Buddhism too.",2019/02/13,KatieSmithExplores,"Norfolk, United Kingdom"
We got there and the first moment we arrived at the square people want to sell things to us. My girlfriend was wearing a long dress to the ground but she could not enter because her dress was open on the side.

"Sinharaja Forest Reserve is yet very well known to tourist that in a day there are in average about 25 groups of tourists visiting the forest via Kudawa entrance. But that also makes it less commercialised than those more well known national parks. A guide is required to be accompanied in the tour of Rs1000. We have bought the long socks as well to protect ourselves from the leeches of Rs 350 per pair.It was thankful to have Jayala with us who has 8 years of experience of working as guide there. Without his explanation to us about the trees and the animals around, the whole tour might turn out to be a sheer forest hiking. Also, the guides there in general have very sharp eyes and good sense of whereabouts of the animals and insects. Some real tiny lizards and frogs could hardly be seen because also of their camouflage. And on the other hand the birds or even the pink face leave eating macaques are shy from people.To be able to have better view on the forest lives around, one may need a good binocular or long distance telephoto lens not less than 300mm. Just be aware of the leeches that I have got one bite to my tummy without a bit of feeling till the guide realized a patch of blood on my t-shirt.Overall, we enjoyed a lot learning throughout the tour arousing our interest to know more.",2019/02/12,ALau-TA,"Hong Kong, China"
We entered the forest from Kudawa entrance accompanied by a guide provided by the Forest Dept. We traveled along the usual trail which was around 10km.

"We had a very early start to ensure good views at Worlds End, which paid off. Very beautiful scenery at both view points and although it feels like a rugby scrum when you first arrive at the start of the trail, due to the terrain, the crowds thin out.I imagine when the rhododendrons are in flower the scenery in the rest of the area must be spectacular.I was surprised how tricky the terrain was though. It was billed as a hike but there are a lot of boulders to navigate and shale surfaces which makes slipping a real risk.Anyone not fully mobile should be aware before setting out. We had a very hot day so take water, you will be checked for plastic items on the way into the trail but are allowed water bottles.",2019/02/12,660Traveller,Southampton

Saw a lot of peacocks, crocdiles，elephants， birds, monkeys, snakes etc. There were not much decoration or human changes to the park other than the signs saying : Animals are the true owner of the jungle, which deserves everybody’s respect. it is also obvious that all the animals are “at home” here, most of them just carried on what they were doing when we drove by, such an interesting experience.",2019/02/12,Dealand,"Guangzhou, China"
"We had a morning and afternoon safari at Yala and loved them both. Yes it is an early start and at the ticket area it feels very much like wacky races, actually there were a few times in the park it felt like that too, but that was well worth it for what we saw.Our guide for the whole holiday got one of the park guides to come with us for both trips which proved invaluable. He was able to point birds and animals out which we would never have seen. We also saw a leopard as he was in radio contact with other guides so knew when it had been sighted. Magical to see it with only a couple of other jeeps around.I can’t say enough good things about the day, but would say having a 4 wheel drive vehicle, good driver and additional guide maximised the experience for us. Anyone with neck or back problems might find it a challenge, you do get thrown about a bit whilst travelling around due to the terrain.",2019/02/12,660Traveller,Southampton
"Galle Fort area is really charming and historical for the area. The Dutch influence is still prevalent today. Buildings and cobble-stone streets still maintain the Dutch look and feel. Many streets in the area are far to narrow for cars, only motorbikes and pedistrians. I believe this is what elevated the charm of this area. It's clean, quaint and deliberate in it's design. The Fort area is avery large land mass (not indoors) and could potentially take all day to see, if you are walking at a leisurely pace. I recommend seeing it more than one day in order to spend time relaxing and taking in all of the majestic, panoramic views. An added bonus is the Galle Cricket Club is directly across the street and you get these amazing views of cricket practice and games....at no additional cost. Tuk Tuks are plentiful in this area and their prices are extremely reasonable. Lots of great variety in cuisine at reasonable/low prices. I even stopped to have the most delicious scope of pineapple gelato on my walk around. There is an ATM in the area at the centrally located round-about (it's bit harder to find an ATM for Union Pay, but if you leave the Fort area and head less the 600 meters across the street, you will find banks that take Union Pay).All in all, a great place to hang out.",2019/02/12,simplyputFOREVER,"Hangzhou, China"

Once at the top the views are spectacular but please don't risk permanent injury or death for the sake of Instagram like we saw many people doing. Just enjoy the breathtaking natural beauty of Sri Lanka's hill country and walk back down. On the way there is also a zipline ($20 USD) which my wife did and found to be very enjoyable. I am too big for the zipline, so that just shows you how easy the peak is to climb. If my tubby butt can do it, so can you, and you'll be rewarded with the views from the top. Have fun, and stay safe!",2019/02/12,150dwaynem,"Box Hill, Australia"

"Just a short walk out of the center of Ella, once you go through the official entry pathways you may come across people who offer to take photos for money, which is only fair as they are dressed up in traditional clothing and this is their source of income. It’s not very expensive (maybe 100 rp).Once you hit the steps it is a steep climb, which I recommend to do slowly to avoid altitude dizziness. There are two parts to the peak and you can choose to go further and climb down then up the second half of the peak which again is well worth it. They do sell water at the base but it is a tough walk so make sure you stock up on water before you ascend.",2019/02/12,Auzzy87,"Perth, Australia"

"I love visiting the temple of the tooth, mostly because of our local guide who we found through withlocals website. Buddhima explained a while bunch of interesting stuff to us that if you just go on your own you won't get. Both my wife and I initially got knocked back at the gate due to dress code. Although my shorts just covered my knees it wasn't enough, and her dress had a slit in the side she forgot about until we got there, and you know what? We were fine with that. This is one of the most sacred places in Sri Lanka and if you wish to be an ethical and respectful tourist do what is asked of you. You do also have to be barefoot which is normal visiting a Buddhist temple anywhere in the world. We both bought wraps from a nearby stall 300lkr each is about double the price they should be, but what are you gonna do? You pay a ""tourist tax"" everywhere in Sri Lanka and after all, were talking about roughly $5. Entry is 1500lkr each, and the automatic ticket machines do not give change so get that sorted before you go. To those complaining about these rules and costs I say you should either suck it up, or reconsider your worthiness of visiting such a venerated site. We were lucky enough to visit at a time where we caught a glimpse of the tooth relic in its casket which is apparently 7 ever smaller caskets like a Russian doll. Yes it was crowded with locals and tourists alike because as I said before, it is the most sacred site in Sri Lanka for Buddhists. If you're not prepared to deal with that you probably shouldn't go. My wife and I loved it. For my wife that is rare, she believes ""if you've seen one temple, you've seen them all"". As you can probably tell from my review I really enjoy the experience of exploring another religion which you can best do by visiting these sites. I totally recommend visiting, but make sure you have a guide to get the most out of your visit. Find Buddhima in withlocals and she'll take you to some amazing food and other sights around town as well.",2019/02/12,150dwaynem,"Box Hill, Australia"
"We visited the temple on a Sunday afternoon. Men must be wearing long trousers or at least 3/4 length shorts over the knees. We bought a sarong from one of the nearby stalls for my husband so that we could still visit. I think women would need to cover their shoulders, so t shirts with sleeves are fine, not sure about thin strapped tops. Entry is 1,500 Sri Lankan rupees each. You must have the exact money as the ticket machines do not give change and credit cards are not accepted. Shoes are not allowed and have to be removed and placed in lockers before entering. The queue for the lockers was long and we got away with placing our shoes into our small rucksack.Unfortunately it was very busy, uncomfortably so and to the point where it spoilt our visit as it was almost impossible to move around inside the temple. Not sure if this is normal or we just choose a very popular time. We left quicker than we might mainly because of the crowds - lots of large coach parties were there as well as locals and there was no attempt to stagger the larger parties arriving. What we saw of the temple was beautiful but I don’t feel able to give much of a review of the temple itself as it was so difficult to see anything!",2019/02/12,Andrea P,"London, United Kingdom"

"The only reason for coming to Sigiriya is to see this rock and the old city on the top, so of course we had to do it. The climb looks worse than it is and providing you start early - by 8:30 the crowds aren't too bad and most of the climbing up is in the shade. There is a big terrace maybe 60% of the way up to stop and rest or maybe not continue beyond it. The part where you walk up a spiral staircase welded to the rock face is a bit disconcerting for some, and it's immediately followed by the cave paintings which we rather missed in the recovery from the spiral staircase! only to find that the next stage was down a different spiral staircase. Great views from the very top, but no explanatory signage whatsoever, which really is poor, there's plenty of space and the amount being charged to foreigners to visit is high, so surely they can do better.The climb down was obviously easier, but then on the way back to the car park we had to pass a snake charmer with a cobra and another man with a large python - this was not what we came to see and freaked my wife. I wouldn't visit again. The next day we went to Ritigala - a much better site.",2019/02/11,TheDutchmanTheHague,"London, United Kingdom"

He was older and when I was tired and slipped on a wet rock, he was very nimble in his flip flops. The ride to the forest preserve was also exciting. We were the only ones around on the day we went.

My biggest warning is not about the waves/surf though... after my short time swimming and even going back out to the open water to rub/brush off excess sand from myself, I found that sand had gotten everywhere and it was quite difficult to remove. I took 3 showers that night and still had sand all over. When I woke up the next morning, there was sand all over my bedsheets and pillow. After my 4th shower since my swim, I finally managed to rid myself of the feeling, but I don’t like the feeling of having sand everywhere. For surfers, you will love the beach, for non surfers (especially those who can’t swim strongly), I would recommend going elsewhere.",2019/02/11,ChibiOdango,"Xuzhou, China"

"Though this is such a main touristy attraction, it's well worth it. When you first arrive around 6 am, it's full of cars and people running to the ticket booth right when it opens, which makes you nervous about the crowds. But as soon as you get on the trail, of which there are two choices, the crowds really thin and most of the time you are hiking on your own. The hike is not strenuous, with few steep uphill points, and the scenery alternates between forest and open plain which is really cool. The viewpoint at the top is amazing.

The park is nice but it's too crowded, we definitely preferred Uda Walawe national park: it's smaller and easier to see animals. When you are visiting Yala you have to be lucky because even if the drivers comunicate amid them, the time is not enough to reach the place. It happened twice that one driver saw a leopard and called all other drivers and at certain point there were something like 30 jeeps around the bushes hoping to see the leopard but the animal in front of 30 cars was too scared to come out and everyone was just there fo anything and at the same time it looked like being in a zoo.Didn't like at all. 3 stars just for the park but not for how it is managed.",2019/02/09,ScarlettOtto,
"We had a wonderful time at the national park. I would like to make 2 suggestions. 1: limit the number of jeeps that enter the park at a given time, the smell and pollution is enough to chase all the wild life away. There is no use to address the animals as the true owners of the jungle when we humans invade and pollute their land. 2: charge the tourist for the toilet usage, trust me we would pay for clean toilets.

Add to that the many but not all, irresponsible and reckless drivers and your so called safari was made pointless, stressfull and deeply disappointing. They will need to overhaul their visiting system, no more cars with one or 2 people in it. Maximum number of cars at one time and must be under 100 probably and educate drivers and this is for starters. Utter madness and as I said pointless.

The Leopard is the most difficult but we were lucky enough to have a young female willing to pose & in no hurry to go any where,fantastic.

The temple contains a Tooth of the Buddha taht is worshipped and offerings given daily. We watched the ceremony with lots of drumming and praying.

"Located in Kandy, long a center of the Buddhist faith, the stunning 17th-century Temple of the Tooth (Śrī Dalada Maligawa) is believed to house the left upper canine tooth of the Lord Buddha himself. This precious relic attracts white-clad pilgrims, bearing lotus blossoms and frangipani, every day. According to legend, the tooth was taken from the Buddha as he lay on his funeral pyre. It was smuggled to Sri Lanka in 313 AD, hidden in the hair of Princess Hemamali who fled the Hindu armies besieging her father's kingdom in India.It immediately became an object of great reverence and was enshrined in a series of nested jeweled reliquaries. The tooth was brought out for special occasions and paraded on the backs of elephants, which are sacred to the Buddha. Where it survived numerous attempts to capture and destroy it. When the capital was moved to Kandy, the tooth was taken to the new city and placed in temples built to honor it. The temple was originally built under Kandyan kings between 1687 and 1707",2019/02/09,ksadiga,Udupi
Our excellent Antiquity driver/Guide Shehan took us to this temple at the time of prayer when the tooth is on display at night.

The first half was uneven stepping stones (which wasn’t too bad) and the second half was rock scrambling - whereas Sigiriya Rock was all stairs.One problem with Sigiriya was the museum which was right at the beginning, before the walk - our driver told us to go there and it was really good but we didn’t do it justice as we were itching to get going on the climb.",2019/02/07,D445CWroseb,"Louth, United Kingdom"

"We were staying at the excellent 98 acres so I used this as my exercise everyday.Only a short walk to the bottom of the peak.It is an easy climb to the top and well worth the effort.Fantastic views from the top,you can also see the valley down to the lowlands.You can also make it a double attraction because Ravana Zip Wire has just opened which starts at the bottom of Adams Peak.",2019/02/07,BeachyNairobi,Nairobi

From monastery to a grand palace and being returned to the monks after the regaining the place. the site has loads of cultural paintings. the climb is tiring but enjoyable, however the structure looks slightly precarious and whimsy.

"We stayed here for one night, breaking up our stay in Sri Lanka before taking a flight from Columbo to Male. Unfortunately when we arrived they had messed up our booking so thought we were due to stay the next evening. Once they had realised this was incorrect it was sorted pretty quickly and consequently I think we actually got a room upgrade, after all it was our honeymoon. The hotel has a nice pool which also has some amazing sea views. It has its own beach and a number of other facilities. I got the impression however, that despite the very impressive entrance and grand nature of the hotel it was quite tired and dated. If I’m honest it needs quite a significant amount of investment to bring it back to its former glory. The staff also failed to make the best impression - there seemed a lack of coordination and knowledge, for example when we received a call to say our driver had arrived we returned to reception only to find no one seemed to know who our driver was or had any recollection of the fact they’d called us. We ate in the seafood restaurant on the beach which was lovely and very good value for money. You weigh out your fish and it’s cooked to how you like it, id defiantly recommend this. Breakfast in the Grovenors restaurant was a bit of a shambles. Whilst the food was okay we were put out by the very poor service - we were not seated so tried to find our own seat to find all of them had reserved signs. When we had no option but to sit in one of these we were confronted with a very cross waiter who told us to move but could not suggest a seat. Not ideal! Overall for a quick pit stop in Columbo I would recommend this hotel, however not for more than a couple of nights.",2019/02/06,Rachel1992London,"Reading, United Kingdom"

"Worth a look if you are in the Kandy area. A guide approached us on entry which was actually very useful as we might not have gained such an insight without him. The guide was free, just tipped him at the end according to the experience. The temple is beautiful inside, you first need to take your shoes off before entering. Once inside there are two queues, one slower that goes up close to the tooth (you only see the box it is in) and one is a faster queue that is further away. We took the fast one and still had a great experience. We then went on to see the library, royal balcony, taxidermy elephant etc all located within the temple. Lots to see but better with a guide so you know what you’re looking at. All in all it probably took 1 hour. Dress code - men and women need to cover their shoulders and legs (so no shorts for men) you can buy sarongs and long trousers from a stall outside.

We saw a very few people struggling badly who we think should have been told to stop. There are either stone or metal steps (with handrails all the way). We climbed at about 9.30 a.m. and it wasn’t too crowded but coming down we could see all the hoards going up the other side!

The paintings in the caves on the rock are amazing when you think how long they have been there. Well worth the visit but wear suitable footwear for the climb. Take plenty of water with you as you cannot get any once you are on the rock.

We gave him 1000lkr tip (+ the tour price) which seemed not to be enough and he asked could we give him more..? Its also a shame that this place seems to be happy to take money from tourists because ticket prices are high for foreigners, as the shoe storage. And this shoe place wasnt very nice also.

We took the climb steadily and reached the top which had a magnificent view and we felt it was an achievement and enjoyed walking around. I must say I wondered why the stray dogs made the climb!!!. We went quiet early in the morning, which helped to avoid the heat and some of the crowd. You need to allow 2 and a half hours to climb up, walk around and climb back down.

Entry is 1500 rupees.There are a series of paintings telling about the history of the site and try and go later in the afternoon around 4 when it was quieter so you have more room to appreciate this sacred site.",2019/02/04,708Robin,"West Sussex, United Kingdom"
We had a guide and this is a very sacred place for Buddhist to come. It goes back hundreds of years and feels very holy. I'm pleased we visited it and will remember it. We were there for a couple of hours as there was a lot to see and watch. A must see visit if you are in Kandy,2019/02/04,juliaelizabethann,"Orpington, United Kingdom"

Spent a couple of days enjoying beach life. The coconut trees were a welcome to keep in the shade ... great to watch the first time surfers learning to surf... a few people selling their wares but not enough to be annoying. At the far end of the beach a few cafes where the water lapped at our feet whilst we enjoyed lunch... well worth a visit ( if you are lucky you will see a turtle or two in the ocean),2019/02/03,NicolaV307,"Corsham, United Kingdom"

"We had a fantastic experience at Sigiriya. We may have done it a little differently to most, but here are some pointers if you are like us... our intention was to get to the top without too many crowds ;)We got to the ticket office super early - 6:30am for a 7:00am opening. We were first in the queue, got our tickets (30 USD / 5520 LKR per adult) and headed straight through the park towards Lion Rock.Without sounding like d**kheads, we are quite fit, so it only took us about 20 minutes to get to the summit from the gate where you provide your ticket. One mistake we made was going straight towards the summit and skipping the spiral staircase to Cave Fresco, when we came back down from the summit the line was super long so we weren't too interested in waiting.The top is absolutely stunning. We were the only ones up there so had uninterrupted views, and no other people in our photos! We took our time, enjoying the multiple terraces. By the time we were making our way back down, there were already hundreds of people making their way up which we were quietly happy to have avoided.",2019/02/03,alicefry,"Singapore, Singapore"

Also bus 101 from the Fort although the bus takes about an hour due to the traffic. Tuk-tuk would be a quicker option than the bus but much more expensive.The beach is really very pleasant and makes for a great escape from the chaos of Colombo. Waves were quite rough when we were there but it didn’t stop people swimming and made for good body boarding. There is a variety of bars and restaurants on the beach.",2019/02/03,Dakles,"Southampton, United Kingdom"

The animals do not seem to be bothered by the jeeps, but you do get a lot of fumes from the engines when the jeeps do get together. Unfortunately we did not see a leopard, although one had been seen on the morning safari, but that is a 0600 start, so it might be better to see the animals waking up, as we saw more wildlife after 1600 when it was a bit cooler.We saw a variety of animals, a few crocodiles, water buffalo (lots of them) 2 herds of elephants including one at a watering hole with tiny and still pink one month old baby, two types of deer, iguana, peacock, a snake, eagle hawk, including one ripping a pond heron to bits in a tree and plenty of green bee eaters.

Would definitely recommend going before 11am or after 3pm as we went in the middle of the day and it was sweltering heat with very little shade around the outer wall itself.

"Given that this is probably the main reason for most visitors to come to Kandy and a feature of most Sri Lanka must see lists, we were a bit disappointed. Decoration and architecture wise this temple is nothing too special nor particular impressive. Unless you are Buddhist or his tooth relict is meaningfully you in another way (note you actually don’t see it unless you come during the two daily praying times) then you might not take too much home from this visit. At 1500R entrance is relatively expensive and depending on the time of your visit it might be crowded. Note strong enforcement of the clothing order, so wear long trousers and cover your shoulders.",2019/02/03,BlueMaharaja,"London, United Kingdom"
"I wish I had looked into this ahead of time but the temple is quite conservative. You need to have your legs, arms back covered, and nothing sheer. temple has 3 ceremonies a day - make sure you come during one of those so you can line up and see the tooth. if you dont want to line up - theres a second line behind the very long line you can skip to just see the tooth.",2019/02/03,eenbean,"Boston, Massachusetts"
We had thought of this as a handful of sights in Sri Lanka that we really had to see. I think it was the only one that didn't really live up to the hype. We saw much more fascinating and beautiful religious practices elsewhere for sure. The architecture of the whole place is very interesting and it makes for an atmospheric 1 hour visit.

The entire hike (both ascent and descend) takes approx 3-4 hours depending on the queue of people.While this is a UNESCO world heritage site plenty of maintenance/upkeep is needed specially at the rock/stone steps. The width/size of each step in many areas is less than a foot! How does UNESCO think normal and large footed human visitors can carefully trek here?

Get there early as it’s cooler and much less crowded - 8 am good we had an almost unimpeded climb up ( and despite guide books mentioning vertigo inducing, it’s fine! ) By the time we came down there were queues on all stairs. The Sigiriya damsels are beautiful ( more very similar in Dambulla caves) . If you want to spend more time in the gardens after it’s a better option and you can just go back the same way ignoring the “ foreigners car park” sign ( or cut back through the Cobra cave ) Don’t miss the museum as it has a good reconstruction of the whole site and a video with ideas of what it would have looked like at different times. Oh and original photos of rediscovery of Sigiriya with terrifying bamboo scaffolding!",2019/02/02,emme991,"Southampton, United Kingdom"
This walk is incredible and just take your time there is no rush at all let people over take you if you want plenty of places to step to one side. Don’t be alarmed with queues they quickly go down. The views are amazing. We got there at about 0930 but took about half hour to get the tickets as foreigners have to go nr the museum to get tickets.

I went up early morning. Bought my overpriced ($ 30) ticket at 7.30 am and was on the top at 8.30 am. The gardens and ruines are very well kept and certainly interesting. The climb is not a problem as long as there is no congestion. Congestion started at 9.30. It was close to Chinese newyear which explain ed the many busloads of chinese tourists. After having been in Polonnaruwa and Anahadrapura the site on top was not adding much. The view from the top was good but not as good as from Pidangula.

"A really disappointing experience that made me angry. In the morning hundreds of Jeeps are waiting till 6:00 a.m. to enter the park. One minute later the race begin. Noisy, stinky Jeeps everywhere. If a ""guide"" spot one of the highlights he just call other Jeeps, ending up with 50-80 Jeeps looking for the leopard on a small road. Employers (not rangers) are there to order the Jeeps in a queue, so you could see the leopard for 30 seconds and then NEXT!! All the time the engines were on, different guides shouting all over the place. This has nothing to do with a National Park, it is more like a zoo. But the worst thing is that all the drivers try to get as close to the animals as possible with no respect to them. At our tour an elephant family with little babys were to scared to cross the street to the water hole because 50 Jeeps drove alongside them (really loud, guides are shouting) oto get the best view. And the ""rangers"" of the park were there to order the queue and supporting this behaviour.Seems like every idiot with a Jeep can enter in Yala NP!! We saw no Jeep that behaved right and threatend the animals with respect! Supported by the ""rangers"" of the NP.I would totally not recommend this NP if you love animals. It is just a mass processing, supported by the national park.",2019/02/02,Joshua S,
"When we booked our safari 9 months ago we didn’t realise just how busy it was , and were not looking forward to hoards of Jeeps, and regretting that we had booked 3 safaris.However our driver was very good - they all communicate by phone if there’s a bear or leopard sighting. First afternoon we saw loads of elephants but no leopard, second morning nothing much ( a peacock with its tail up and Indian rolller bird- fantastic bright blue) so we’re a bit despondent. That afternoon he got word of a leopard in a tree ( only legs visible ) so we headed towards it , only to find another casually walking down the road with only us to watch it . It lay down in the sun and only about 20 mins later moved on after about 10-15 other jeeps arrived . Went back to our hotel early after that and found a mum elephant with a 2 weeks old , and another older baby walking along the side of the road.

"Yala National Park needs a lot of regulation before it can be a truly enjoyable wildlife experience. As it is, the park it completely overrun with Jeeps who are all competing with each other to get to any nearby wildlife worth seeing. We spent more time caught in a cloud of diesel than actually watching wildlife. Our very first experience in the park, not even five minutes after entering, was when a sloth bear was spotted (a rare sighting) before the pack of Jeeps had had a chance to disperse throughout the park, causing a 20-minute exhaust-filled gridlocked traffic jam while the 35+ Jeeps all jockeyed for a position where they could spot the bear. Not exactly an authentic wildlife experience.The guides are more motivated by the large game and leopards than the smaller animals, which means a lot of wildlife is bypassed or glossed over. Yala has a lot of potential to be a wonderful park where people can experience wild Sri Lanka, but before that can happen the country needs to decide to severely cut back on the quantity and practices of the safari operations.

He was one of the most annoying guides who talked at us and would not give breath for us to ask questions... if we looked away or wandered to have a look at something he would tap us on the shoulder or tell us to come back. The Temple was very interesting, but the guide made it so much longer than what we wanted to spend in there and the other couple were getting bored.

All the steps and sweat is worth it, the view is absolutely breath taking. I would say that all ages and abilities could climb/walk the rock as the steps as proper steps not a natural rock edge... there a plenty of “rest” places too on the way so if you do want to grab a quick water then you can without feeling like your holding anyone up.

"At first I really hesitated with visiting Lion´s Rock, cause earlier that day we already climbed Pidurangala and we were told by many people that Pidurangala is enough, cause entrance fee is low and you can actually see Lion´s rock´s majestic shape from it. Anyway I decided to go for both and woow, it was so worth it.. Entrance is 25USD and it is really crowded, but that experience is unforgettable. First you walk through ruins of water gardens with turns to several caves and ancient trees and the rock is right in front of your eyes, so you have good chance to look over it in detail. The walk itself is superb and I recommend to stop at all places marked on map by the entryway of area (take photo of it). There is also some turn to abandoned hospital up the hill that I missed but I heard it is worth it too cause there are some giant memorial trees to see. Then when you reach the rock, long climb in crowd of tourists starts. In about halfway of climb there is another formation sitiing on base of the rock and there you can rest next to famous Lion Paws, stunning! My favorite part was maze of glorious terraced gardens on the top of the rock which was one of the best things I´ve ever seen and also grand 360 degree view over jungle. Polonnaruwa and Anuradhapura can be seen from top in distance. Even if you are low on budget, you should really consider visiting this place cause it is a true gem of Sri Lanka and something special that you won´t see anywhere else!Tips: Before climbing have in mind to buy water and use toilet that is placed by the entrance, there is nothing except terraces on the top or along the way up, then again by the exit there are many stalls with souvenirs and refreshment. Climbing is best in the early morning cause of less people (and sunrise), also it gets really hot there.

"We were fortunate to go on a cloudy day which meant it was not so hot without the sun. We also used a really good guide for the tour, which was 3000 rupees and well worth it, as he was able to give us the fascinating history of the place as we climbed the rock. The first part as you go through the gardens is flat but once you start the climb there 1202 steps to the top. If you don't like heights this probably is not for you, but if you can make it to the top it is well worth it as there are remains of the palace at the top and great views Yes it will be crowded, particularly on the last section so go early in the day, we got there at just after 0900. You will see plenty of monkeys on the way up, both in the gardens and on the top.If you have the energy afterwards go up Pidruangala afterwards, which took me an hour in total, and only 500 rupees compared to 4500 for Sigiriya. It is about 15 minutes away and you will also get a great view of Sigiriya. It is a more tricky climb on the last section as there are no steps.",2019/01/28,708Robin,"West Sussex, United Kingdom"
"As with many things in Sri Lanka ""foreigners"" pay alot more for entry but keep it in perspective it is still reasonable compared to say attractions in the UK and price is relative to income - at least foreigners get a closer car park!Well worth the climb, takes about 30 mins, I'm by no stretch of the imagination an athlete but it was fine even at midday. Yes it was hot, but plenty of places to stop and catch your breath. Watch out for the monkeys, they will grab any food, quite funny to watch when an unsuspecting tourist has their lunch snatched from under them. Some of the steps are narrow in places but still alot better than the old way of ascending which is still visible - no thanks!!Breathtaking views at the top make the climb so worthwhile. A real panorama and quite miraculous to see the ruins and try to understand how they built this 200 metres up in the air all those years ago.

We had a great tour to Kandy Temple of the Tooth Relic and Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage.  Kumar was a safe driver/guide and was very flexible with our requests.  The drive is long but well worth it.,2019/01/28,ChaChingNEW,"Woodbury, Minnesota"
There is a lot to see here. Beautiful buildings and art work. Interesting couple of small museums. Filed past the sacred tooth twice but the door wasn’t open. Wasn’t really a problem though as we felt we’d had so much to see.,2019/01/28,Bell-on-a-bicycle,
I'm not a Buddhist so perhaps the significance was a little lost on me but I've seen much prettier temples in Thailand but understand this has a deeper significance for Buddhists. As is usual in SL foreign tourists pay many multiples of what the locals do (1500 LKR at time of writing) and you even pay 100 LKR to store your shoes which is free is many places but still hardly anything - more the principal. I felt the building was slightly bland and only marginally more interesting inside but maybe that's me. Usual people trying to sell you a guided tour etc but just politely decline and Google if you're that interested. Worth doing if you're in Kandy but I wouldn't make a special trip here personally.,2019/01/28,Mark H,"Exeter, United Kingdom"
"Part of the temple, especially the outer walls and some of the roof has been renovated since the earlier bomb attack, but the essential internal structure is original. The wood carving and the painted plasterwork is magnificent and warrants close examination because of the intricate detail. The tooth relic is not on public view of course, but it is housed in a special upstairs enclosure. When you go up to this gallery lots of local worshippers are seated on the floor meditating and chanting and you really capture the spirituality of the place, so it’s worth standing quietly to soak in the atmosphere. The image gallery has painted wall plaques telling the Buddha story which is explained in English, so worth viewing if you are interested.There are two museums which you can then enter using your entry ticket for the temple complex. We visited the first which includes some royal artifacts ( clothing and jewellery) and more general treasures (coins and vessels etc) and historical photos of the temple. Some of the labelling is in English making it easy to follow. We didn’t have time to visit the other museum, but I understand that it is a more general one about the Buddhist religion. We spent about one and a half to two hours looking round the temple, taking photos and visiting the first museum so you need to allow time. The gardens are well maintained and contain a couple of historically interesting statues of the royal couple, including the princess who hid the tooth in her hair to bring it from India and the child martyr who is venerated by the locals.",2019/01/28,paulineandaland,"Etchingham, United Kingdom"
Our travel agents suggested that we start the climb at 4pm but as our driver pointed out this is the time of day when the rock is radiating at maximum after a day in the sun. The last section from the plateau is about 200 feet high and not for the faint hearted but well worth the effort. Go as early in the morning as possible - we were back down by 9.15am - and take plenty of water. There are no facilities as this is a religious place but the view from the top is stunning. Beware the men who are on hand to offer climbing assistance as they are interested only in being paid and you don't need their help but do listen to your driver/guide as the history is fascinating,2019/01/27,Swale64,"South West England, United Kingdom"
My husband and I went and it was one of the highlights of our trips to Sri Lanka. Absolutely stunning location and scenery and really brilliant to see the staff checking everyone's bags to make sure they weren't bringing in plastic and environmentally unfriendly substances into the park - but really annoying and disappointing to see whilst we were on our hike that some selfish people had thrown plastic and rubbish around. Anyway we loved this place and felt completely at one with nature. Definitely recommend it.,2019/01/27,Misbah A,"London, United Kingdom"

"You must go if you are located in Tangalle. It is only 30 min from Tangalle. The parking costs 30 LKR (if you come with your own vehicle). There are lots of vendors at the parking. You can buy water and some snacks. First, you pass the school yard and just before the first two cave temples, there is also ticket office (500 LKR/person). The area is not maintained, but it is a worth a visit. Some steps are pretty steep but there is a fence almost all the way to the top. We went today at around 10AM (sunday) and it was not crowded at all. Our 2 and a half year old almost made himself to the top. The walk is not hard at all. The ride from Tangalle takes approx. 30 min (one direction) and we spend cca. 1 hour there - with walking, taking photos,...Make sure you cover your legs, and you need to take off the shoes every time you enter into one of the caves.

To reach the farthest point you need to walk the saddle back where further sights can be enjoyed. For those of you unable to walk, the journey can be partly made by tuk tuk or even scooter.

For just 500 rps. you can climb the very nearby Pidurangale rock and that as even a stunning view. As all over Sri Lanka the enterance tickets for sights are extremely high for foreigners. We did both and Lions rock is not worth the money but worth the climb and the view are also stunning. The climb is a little easier. Unfortunately your spendings never will reach the local people. We talked about that with some local people on the site.,2019/01/26,robertcoumans,"Maastricht, The Netherlands"
"I was quite apprehensive about climbing the rock as i do not do that well with heights. The initial steps upwards climb through some great boulders and offer some great views. On the way to the Lion's claws you can either follow the mirror wall or go up the spiral staircase to see the wall paintings. The final climb up a metal staircase to the palace area at the top is a bit hairy. I am so glad i did it and i know i had to go back down but it was well worth it.

"There are two safari times at Yala, morning and afternoon. We went in the morning and we found it comfortable in terms of the heat. The safari itself is about 3 hours in duration. The National park is beautiful, and the animals roam free in their natural habitat. Lots of elephants, mongeese, wild pigs, buffalo, and colourful bird life. The main attraction was Leopards, but there are only small numbers of these and spotting one is not a guarantee at all. We did not see any, but some were spotted the previous day. Nevertheless we very much enjoyed the safari and have great memories of it. Yala is a long way from Colombo, maybe 6 hours by car. I’m sure it would be a much shorter trip if you drove from say Sigiriya Rock to Yala, that may be just 3-4 hours? It is a long drive there so be sure that you want to do it before you book! We stayed at Thaulle Resort which is a great place nearby (10-15 minutes drive from the park entrance). So we visited the park and then relaxed at the resort afterwards.",2019/01/25,Nolsie1,"Melbourne, Australia"

"I visited Yala on 15 January. Whilst it's fantastic to see elephants, deers, peacocks and water buffalo roaming freely it was the sheer amount of jeeps and the frenzy around possible leopard sightings that was very disappointing. We raced passed two elephants who were grazing at the side of the road - I had to yell at our driver to stop as we had wanted to see elephants and these were so close. He'd got word of a possible leopard sighting up ahead and at one point started reversing very quickly and only didn't hit one of the elephants (who'd walked behind the jeep) as we were all shouting at him to stop. I have video of a jeep up ahead driving so close to an elephant, intimidating it to move which it did. Up ahead there were several jeeps - it actually reminded me of the paparazzi that followed Princess Diana around. The leopard walked across the road and didn't seem fazed by all these people and jeeps which I was relieved to see. Others on the trip said that in Africa they are very reverential about animal sightings - they keep their distance and people are asked to keep quiet to not disturb the wildlife - it was the opposite here. Later there was another leopard sighting and the amount of jeeps tearing along the road and frenzied driving was absolutely ridiculous. What a shame. Yala's posters say 'Animals are the true owners of the jungle, make it your purpose to save their lives' - maybe Yala should remind their jeep drivers of that message.",2019/01/25,CarolynH-UK,"Leeds, United Kingdom"

The road/track to the start of the peak is a well travelled path with many walkers. To the bottom of the actual peak is fairly easy going but once you get to the base of the peak then be prepared for a fairly steep climb if you want to take in the view from the very top.

"This is a national park and it does require money but I have to wonder where it goes. We were told 3 different distances to the various 'signature spots' and the signposts give a fourth opinion. This should not be attempted by anyone with a hip, knee or ankle problem and hiking boots are almost a necessity. The tracks are not maintained in any way and consist of reasonably steep climbs and descents through deep ruts strewn with boulders, rocks and loose stones. Furthermore it is suppoesed to be a nature walk, and we started before sunrise, only to find around 100 vehicles at the the first gate with several 100 tourists clamouring for tickets. We entered and drove 5kms to the second gate to find even more vehicles and people. Goodness knows what this is like later in the day although when we left at about 9.30 am there must hjave been thousands in the park. As described, walking is difficult and the experience was not helped by crowds of mainly Asian tourists squawking incessantly and noisily with some even playing their radios for all to hear. The result - no wildlife.When we got to either of the World's Ends we could hardly see a not that impressive view for the crowds of photo and selfie taking tourists. There seemed to be neither control nor wardens on hand and most of the guides were more intent on chatting up their attractive customers than controlling the mobs. Our guide, who was embaraseed by the appalling behavious of the tourists and their mentors, did attempt to quieten the mobs but his efforts were in vain. He did advise us not to attempt a visit to Bakers Falls as that requires climbing and descending by holding on to mangrove roots as the tracks are in an even bigger mess.

"At first I can't decide whether to choose Mirissa or Unawatuna. These 2 beaches is just nearby and u can just go to one place to another by bus. Personally I like Unawatuna more than Mirissa.Mirissa is very popular with Whale Watching. You can ask the price around and I can say most of the boat companies / agents selling the ticket for LKR3000 (discounted price). The difference is only, which agent can give you opportunity to sit at the top deck and also at the front row. I bought a whale watching ticket from Panorama Guesthouse Mirissa with a tagline ""money back guarantee"" if you don't see a whale. Unfortunately I can't even see a whale on that day and didn't get my refund. So, my advice..don't worry much about the seating places on the boat, there is no promises when u dealing with nature, animals, etc. If you have a short time in Mirissa, just enjoy the beach and skip whale watching.",2019/01/22,IzzShariff,"Shah Alam, Malaysia"

Been to there for the second time and after almost 25 years. Nothing much has changed except the local tourist car park was taken a mile away. Walking from that park to the base of the rock itself is exhausting and local people better be prepared for that unless you buy a foreigner ticket. They can travel closer to the entrance and as always the poor local tourist become the second class citizen in his/her own country. It is quite impractical for old age people or kids to walk that much and climb 1200 odd steps steep uphill. I'm not sure the authorities understand this. But there is a local mafia of tuk tuks who go near the entrance without being blocked. It seems the authority has created all this by taking local park so far away and allowing these people to ride in without rules affecting other people. Apart from that it is a very nice place full of amazing views all around. The place is very well maintained including wash rooms. It is very crowded in week ends and holidays as all people mentioned. When it is too crowded it is hard to climb the narrow steps as they are congested. A water bottle is a good thing to have. Very exciting and adventurous climb up steel stair cases which makes most of the people dizzy. Finally it is a great place which I would visit once again.,2019/01/21,Jayan_sl,"Colombo, Sri Lanka"

We had read other reviews so decided to go early in an effort to avoid the crowds. We arrived at 7.45 and queued for 5 to 10 minutes to get a ticket as only one ticket booth was open. The climb although challenging took us 40 minutes although there were several rest points on the way up if you want to take it easy. It was well worth the climb as the sights at the top and the view from the top are great. On the way back down we passed many more people going up and it was getting very busy. My tip is to go early before the tour busses arrive! Ideally by 7.30.,2019/01/21,ray b,

If you are planning an evening climb, make sure to get there before 5 pm before they close the ticketing office. Avoid full moon poya days as during public holidays the place is very crowded.

I should have read reviews first. Having said that there were some interesting things to see and read and I am pleased that we went but I would not go again.",2019/01/21,ray b,
"We were directed to the ""Foreigners"" section on the right as we entered the main gate where we paid our fee and deposited our shoes into small laundry-like plastic baskets.We walked through every structure, temple and building on the property. A few men offered their ""tour guide"" services but we declined. There is a taxidermy ""elephant head"" in one area, and a full elephant near the Ruby Budhhas. You definitely do not see this in every temple.The main Prayer Hall contains large colorful sculptures of Lord Buddha. Thousands of Lord Buddha statues crafted in many styles from many countries are situated throughout the complex. A Bodhi tree was being sprinkled by water from people offering their prayers. Make sure to see the 3 red Ruby Buddhas, the Jade Buddha and Sri Lanka's smallest Buddha.",2019/01/21,Dushi-NY,"NY, NY"
"The cost is USD30.00 and it is worthwhile booking your ticket online. The ticket queues were horrendous and it took us 45 minutes to get tickets, whereas the online ticket collection line was quick. Get there early (opens at 7am) as the queues of people grow quickly. The rock takes 20 minutes to climb if you don’t have holdups, but it took us about an hour to climb, and about 20 minutes on the way down. If you are not good with heights, the final stages of the climb are quite daunting, as you climb up narrow steel staircases that are attached to the sheer face of the rock. The ruins at the top of the rock are impressive and views spectacular. Wear appropriate footwear for climbing hundreds of steps and staircases.",2019/01/20,Nolsie1,"Melbourne, Australia"
"This is a large world heritage area that's very well maintained - it's not only the citadel itself. There are a lot of stairs involved and, on public holidays, a LOT of people (our fault - we should have gone another day). When it's full like that, it's about 3 hours to get to the top of the citadel. We didn't join the queue for that, but did spend hours in the gardens and lower levels which are lovely but that most people seem to charge straight through in their attempt to get to the top. I've got a reason to go back another time, that's not a public holiday!",2019/01/20,Judy12343,"Sydney, Australia"
"A very popular place to visit, the ""Lion Rock"" is a must do for those who like history. Located in an open space it commands great views over the area and although there are modern spiral staircases and concrete steps taking you up to the summit, it is easy to see the original steps carved into the rock. At the top there are pools and landscaped areas and it is hard to understand how centuries ago the people of that age could developers the sight into an impregnable fortress. When visiting go early in the morning and if possible, avoid the weekend when the locals visit. Take plenty of water as there is no place to buy at the top.",2019/01/20,Temperatetraveller,"Swansea, United Kingdom"

"All we know that waterfalls are started from the top of mountains. Always it gravity comes down and you would be needed to use pulling pressure technology to push water towards a mountain after they fell down. However, our Sri Lankan Kings has used the technology to bring up the water from ground floor up to the top of the rock before 7000 years ago. The simple example is Sigiriya. Sigiriya is a rocky outcrop striking geological profile which situated at Matale district above 350m sea level. It has an amazing water resource management technology within the entire site. Its technology shows work of creative nature related mechanism to bring water up to the rock call pre-eminence. The ponds of various proportion that grace the water gardens show the close affinity between the designer and natural features available at the site and also his skill. The fountains show how elementary scientific principles were used for creative work. Those fountains use both the force of gravity and pressure. The ponds in the water gardens were interconnected by a system of underground stone conduits. In certain instance, earthenware aqueducts were also used. The run-off from the water gardens in its final phase went underground and drained into the outer moat which lay beyond the inner moat. Ref. Leaflet published by Central Cultural Foundation.",2019/01/20,travelsrilankaSAM,"Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka"
This was our 3rd visit. It is originally a rock converted into a palace. It's prone to wasp attacks. But there is no recent attacks. Climbing is bit difficult if someone has hight phobia or vertigo. There are water supply system. If you don't like better to bring your own water bottles. You might get thirsty.

"I will preface this review that I visited have just got off my flight so was probably too tired to take it all in...The grounds are lovely and the building itself spectacular. On the ground floor there are a huge range of artifacts covering the whole of Sri Lankas history. The labeling is good and there are clear informative descriptions of each room.Upstairs there are several galleries with paintings, textiles and mask displays. It is worth noting that they close the upstairs areas earlier than the main exhibits downstairs.",2019/01/20,JTSpurz,"Brisbane, Australia"

"Before we set of for our adventure in Sri Lanka I was torn between staying in Unawatuna or Mirissa so we decided to stay a couple of days in each. Me and my partner visited Mirissa for 3 days and was slightly disappointed. We found that the beach was busy and didn’t look anything like the pictures advertised. The beach is big and wide but I prefer smaller beach with more of a tropical feel to it. Don’t get me wrong if your into surfing it’s great but not so great for a relaxing swim.We also found that the main Road was busy, dusty, smelly with lots of litter. If your looking for somewhere that’s calmer and cleaner I would look elsewhere on the south coast. We did do the whale watching in Mirissa which was great! This was with the whale watching club who I would highly recommend. We also stayed in Unawatuna prior to Mirissa. Unawatuna Beach was just ok but a 5 minute tuk tuk away was Wijaya Beach which was heavenly! Long and narrow and lined with palm trees. It was also very clean! You can also watch a beautiful sunset here.",2019/01/20,Aimeetheelephant,"Essex, United Kingdom"

The temple and grounds are much bigger than I thought and much busier. It has such an aura and calmness regardless of the crowds and I loved being part of something real with local people making up the majority of the crowd.

"It would be impossible to understand this place without a guide, got one at the gate for 3000 rupee for about 1 1/2 hours.

"But, despite there being thousands of locals there to see the sacred tooth, it was all very efficient and people were pushed through the various chambers in a set order, at speed, so everyone got to see everything without a wait. You could step off to the side at any time (except near the relic), which plenty of locals did. In a way, it was good being a holiday as the relic was on view which it isn't normally. You still don't see the tooth, but the very pretty containers that it's kept in.",2019/01/20,Judy12343,"Sydney, Australia"

Never expected to see so much inside a Buddhist temple. It houses religious artifacts and antiques including vintage Mercedes and Rolls.,2019/01/20,Ralph T,"Fort Pierce, Florida"
"A great example of a Buddhist temple in Sri Lanka. The place is much bigger than it looks from the outside and as well as the standard Buddha statues, it also houses items which assume were gifts to the temple such as a full size stuffed elephant and a collection of classic cars and everything in between. It was 600 LKR for entry but this also includes entry to another temple round the corner built out into Biera Lake which is worth seeing too. Shoes have to be removed and there are dogs roaming around so watch your step, you might feel more comfortable wearing socks as floors are hard and they can be thrown in the wash straight away when you get back to your hotel.",2019/01/20,CazCowles,"London, United Kingdom"

"Impressive site, definitely place to visit. However, you should try to avoid visiting the place on the hot day as there are a lot of stair climbing which can be challenging for some people, especially in humid and hot weather conditions. Would also suggest to not go off the track as we saw big (probably poisons) snake just next to us. Take water with you when going up!!!",2019/01/19,SigitaK8,

"Really enjoyed climbing up to the top of the rock. Yes, you should be in reasonable shape but not an athlete. I had been apprehensive about the height given other reviews - no need it is v safe and so no heart in the mouth. Site at top very interesting- and view great.Top tip: DO get up early and be there for 7. The crowds are minimal.Supplementary tip: CASH only for tickets",2019/01/19,BlankoMD,
"Lots of other reviewers have described the wonders of Sigiriya and it is something not to be missed. The advice to get there early stands because it gets hotter and more crowded as the morning progresses.We used a guide and I really would recommend doing so because there is so much to see and you will get a great deal more out of your visit if you do so: learn about the context of the place and have the highlights pointed out to you, some of which are small details that you might miss if they aren't identified and their significance explained.I can thoroughly recommend our guide who was Hika +9477 9227548. He speaks excellent English but he can also guide in other European languages, certainly in French and Italian. He looked after us very well, pointed out where we needed to be aware of our footing, explained the historical context clear,y without being over complicated or giving too much detail. We saw so many thanks that we would have missed on our own, he waited while we took photos or caught our breath and he even took my husband's camera and took some shots while he sat out in the shade for the final stretch of the ascent.The only thing I can't do is tell you how much it cost because it was all organised through our driver on our behalf and included in the tour package.",2019/01/19,paulineandaland,"Etchingham, United Kingdom"

"Seen a lot of complaints about the cost for foreigners. For me, it's still value. It's worth it alone if you're into monkeys, as there are loads around who provide excellent photo opportunities.

"The walk starts early at 7am and was frosty, but warmed up. So wear layers first thing in the morning and have a rucksack to put things in as you warm up. The walk took 3 hours and we had only a couple of five minute stops. At the end there was a coffee shop. A shame the guy behind the counter only gave 40 rupees change and not a fifty note. He kept only big notes on top and others in a drawer under the counter. This did not happen to local visitors. Such a shame, ten rupees, is it worth it?",2019/01/19,Nick L,"Norwich, United Kingdom"
"Just a quick note on cost for those planning on doing the world's end walk (mainly because we hadn't appreciated it before going).The entry to the park is around 8400 rupees for two tourists, which is compared with the local's entry fee of 300-500 rupees. On top of the entry fee you also have your tuk-tuk/taxi fee. We paid a flat rate of 3500 rupees from Nuwara Eliya, which is apparently pretty standard. You can obviously split the cost by going in a big group, but I think you then pay extra on your ticket price for taking a larger vehicle. Obviously the cost goes towards the upkeep of the Plain but it is quite steep for anyone touring Sri Lanka on a budget. We got up at 5am to arrive for 6am. Unfortunately upon arrival the ticket machine was broken so we didn't end up getting going until 7:30am(ish). We got very unlucky with the weather in that the fog didn't lift and so the view was none existent. It's also worth preparing your bag in advance. Plastic isn't allowed, although you can take water bottles but you have to remove any plastic seals and the labels. Plastic bags, cartons of drinks with straws etc will be confiscated. All round, it's meant to be great, but just prepare yourself for the cost, and that you might not seen any views at all!",2019/01/19,Kateb123456,

This museum is a great way to spend a morning or an afternoon while in Colombo. It is 1000 LKR for entry but you can buy a joint ticket for this and the Museum of Natural History for 1200 LKR so if you intend to visit both this is worth it. There is no air conditioning in the museum. I went in January and it was fine. If this is a worry then go when it opens at 9am and it should be cooler. There is a cafe on site with a clean toilet. Well worth having a little wander around the park opposite as well.,2019/01/19,CazCowles,"London, United Kingdom"

This is a lovely beach which is kept clean. There are many tourist activities available here but I don't recommend the whale watching as it is not very kind to the whales and dolphins.

In many asian countries they started taking special fee for foreign tourists. Rest were good experience. The Buddha, Bodhi tree, felt something good.

This place is simply amazing.We happened to visit on a public holiday in December so the place was absolutely rammed and it took us almost two hours to get to the top because of the amount of people but I am so glad we went.The view from the top is absolutely spectacular and so is what is left of the citadel at the top.It is quite a long way to the top and it's not ideal if you suffer from vertigo but sooo worth it once you're there. ps. Make sure you have plenty of water with you as it can get pretty hot,2019/01/17,danielarRP,

"So many changes in 20 years. Recalling no people and the walk up a rickety rusty steel pathway of 20 years ago and what was at the top I wondered what it was like now and was it worth $30US or the 5500rupees they were charging on the day. The answer is a yes. It is now a well presented site, in that it has a few descriptions of interesting points along the way whereas Sri Lanka is normally very poor in that respect. There has been lots of excavations of walls of buildings, more ponds and water management features, more steps and not just at the bottom, the same applies to the top of the rock as well. You can now easily imagine a small city atop the rock and at the base. So all in all it is now of historical interest as well as providing excellent views. We went late in the day, starting at 3pm which was great as there was not another person buying a ticket and not many on the way up or down and allowed us plenty of time for photo stops as well as time at the top. I wouldn't want to be there at a busy time constantly queuing in the sun on steel stairs.",2019/01/17,Kevin S,"Pontypridd, United Kingdom"
"Best to do this trek early in the morning, around 8 - 8.30am because there are a lot of other keen tourists.The remnants of foundations of buildings, water ducts and a vast garden area is what first greets you. Take a leisurely stroll through the middle of gardens which lead up to the main steps and just enjoy what life might have been like. The Lion rock is always in full view.As the path narrows it is almost single file up winding steps to get to the first platform ramp which leads on to the enclosed steel spiral staircase. A few people by-passed the spiral staircase but put your fears aside and the climb is well worth seeing the painting inside the cave. No pics allowed at this point but there are plenty on line to see. Make your way back down spiral staircase and along a level ramp which takes you to the foot of the lion paws. there are monkeys everywhere, they tend to keep a distance and are very friendly. If you are really tired after making it to the lions paws you can rest here or keep climbing more steps until you reach the foundation of kings palace. It is a maze of foundations and still filled pools. There 360o views. Plenty of amazing pictures to be had.Even the climb back down to ground level shows a different view of the rock.All up it took about 2 hrs. Take a drink, it was humid at christmas",2019/01/17,I3288ILkevinw,"Negombo, Sri Lanka"
Sigiriya is a really stunning place for tourist. There is massive rock called lion's rock.. various stories based on that.. You must visit to that place..

"We recently went on an early morning safari in Yala National Park. We were staying at the Leopards Nest (which was wonderful) so didn't have far to go although still had to be ready for 4:30am! Arrived at the park gate along with dozens of other jeeps, not what we were expecting at all! When the gates opened it was like a race track! Any animals that had been about must have run for cover! Drivers proceeded to communicate about a leopard sighting and tear around the park at breakneck speed chasing each other and the leopard which we eventually saw a patch of through the branches of a tree if we had binoculars, along with the dozens of other jeeps. Other than this we saw a few elephants, loads of water buffaloes, a few mongoose and peacocks.I know that you are not guaranteed to see anything on safari but I would have preferred a slow, quiet drive around the area spotting what we could with the help of our guide and driver instead of spotting a group of jeeps and trying to see what others were looking at among a lot of shouting and dust as jeeps quite happily moved around trying to get their clients a better view with no consideration to other people or animals! This was my first safari and not at all what I expected. Exciting and disappointing at the same time. The saving grace is that most of the park is not open to tourists giving animals a safe haven away from this mayhem.",2019/01/17,Lendmeyourcomb,

"I'm not even sure why I'm reviewing this - it seems to be about the most famous and popular thing to do in Sri Lanka! Anyway, prepare yourself for crowds, as this place will be heaving with tourists right from the off! The place seems well organised, with a reasonably well-marked path right from the tourist ticket counter ($25pp, if you think it's too expensive then you probably need to get over yourself!) We by-passed the museum so can't comment (rain threatened on our visit and we wanted to get up to the top before it hit), but it looked interesting. We headed up and after a significant number of painful (to Adam's Peak tired legs!) steps we hit the first queue - and really, you should get used to queues at this point because the whole site is a series of bottlenecks and there'll be a lot of tourists visiting who are less fit, capable and worse prepared than you! You can bypass the spral staircases that take you up to the cave art if you like (the paintings are OK) but you'll be in queues right up until the first platform, with the lion's feet. Here it's worth waiting a few minutes to see the local monkeys inevitably stealing food from hapless tourists who think they know better! Then the next queue starts, up the steep staircases to the summit. The climb isn't too bad - you'll not be hurrying due to the bottlenecks anyway. Once at the top, the tourists spread out, and the summit is a decent sized sprawl so can accommodate large numbers pretty easily. It's worth a wander around at the top, just for the different views if nothing else! Then it's time to head down. I'd suggest taking your time and looking at the various caves, because why not while you're here? Then it's back to the conveniently placed tourist car park, via various folks selling food, drinks and tourist tat, which generally seemed a little expensive on initial inspection, though to be expected given the vast numbers of tourists and the very expenisve cameras on show! Anyway, if you're in Sri Lanka and you don't visit Sigiriya then you're an idiot (or scared of heights!), but be prepared for the crowds and you'll probably enjoy the experience a little more.",2019/01/16,diveboard_man,"Leeds, United Kingdom"

"We were at the park as it opened. Already a line of vehicles. Was good to head off early before the heat and the crowds. We did it clockwise, so shorter to get to World's End and longer walk (via Bakers Falls) back. It requires climbing up and down some parts of the track so needs some agility. Recommend good walking shoes or sandals. But nothing too bad if reasonable fitness.Mini World's End was good but World's End was spectacular. Getting there as early as possible seems to be better before it gets too misty. Standing on the edge of a 4,000 ft vertical drop is not good for your vertigo!!!The walk back via the Baker's Falls was also great.In the end was a loop of about 9KMs.Be aware that as you enter the walk they search your bags for any plastics and take them away from you.

Stairs first then after it becomes harder.I was wearing a long white skirt, carrying a handbag and in elevated sneakers. I did not come prepared :)There are 3 peaks, don't be happy when you made it up the first one, it's not over yet.The first peak was very easy, once we made it there we saw Peak 2. It looks easy from where we stand but it's definitely not once you start making your way down the path. It was very windy, I felt abit dizzy and off balance like I am going to fall off, I am not a fan of heights. I did a lot of bending down (putting one foot down first then the other) and holding the ground/rocks for balance, it helped a lot. Then after you need to climb up to the peak 2. Again holding on to rocks and ground. Its like up down up down kinda climb.Once we were up there the view is breathaking but it didn't look very nice in the pictures.There are other people doing the climb, there will be a time/spot that you need to let the other person go first and you need to becareful to hold your position and not slip. After enjoying the view we decided not to proceed to peak 3 and made our way back and again it's down up down up down climb. We wanted to wait for the sunset but we saw thick clouds and assumed that we will not be able to see any sunset and it will get dark soon better to make our way down while theres still light.

"As with most places in Sri Lanka it is expensive to get in and the line for purchasing tickets was long and slow.Once inside there are guides who will escort you, we declined. Ensure to agree to price before using them. If you did not bring drinks there is a small cafeteria to the right before you show your tickets. You will need water, maybe even a soft drink to replenish sugars, you will sweat! Do not wear flip flops, wear shoes with some grip. The first part of the climb is OK, take breaks. Once you get to the lions paw, take a break, sit in the shade, watch the monkeys. The final walk up to the top is not for the faint hearted. It is a sheer drop, I looked at my feet the entire time not wanting to look over the side. Once you get to the top, the view is spectacular! Take your time, have a wander around. The walk down is easy going, you will be directed to the tourist exist where you will see some stalls selling all the same stuff. It is something you need to do at least once.

"We took a very enjoyable morning cycle around Sigiriya followed by a sunset climb. We opted to get a guide and this was well worthwhile as he was very knowledgeable and provided a wealth of fascinating information. It is hard to comprehend a 10,000 room palace with over 350 pools constructed by hand in the 5th century AD, let alone one that includes a throne at the top of Sigiriya.

It's a very nice and calm place out of the bitten track. Personally I loved these old steps carved into stone and these old rocks covered with flowers and lianes more than the temples themselves. On the way you'll see almost nobody except for monkeys. That's a great advantage compared to Dambulla. Well worth visiting,2019/01/12,Aksioma_tg,"Moscow, Russia"

One of the most important Buddhist temples. Went on a Friday one of the busiest days with plenty of locals along. Easy to get to and then join the masses walking through the temple.,2019/01/12,_paul_kearsley,"Melbourne, Australia"
"We were recommended by our B&B owner to visit the temple for the 6:30 ceremony, be warned that this is a very busy part of the day. There’s a ceremony with drums when you first walk in while the recoil is located upstairs. There is a queue on the left side of the stairs which allows you to walk past the door to the room that the relic is in. It may be worth getting in the queue when you first get there so you can get a decent look inside this room. (Note that the door to the relic room is only open for a limited time per day, this explains why it’s so busy) We just walked up the stairs with the rest of the punters and had a bit of a mental squash of humans. I managed to see the Golden Shrine for a few fleeting moments before the mass of humans I was now a part of had moved past the doorway. If I went again I’d get in the queue on the stairs. I still found it an amazing and weird experience, something so sacred I only managed to grab a few seconds with it. Maybe I’m just in a glass half full kind of mood.",2019/01/12,Wipeitonthecat,"South Devon, United Kingdom"
"Back to do the climb as a family for the 4th time in 9 years! Was well worth the trip,this time in windy but nice July weather! The museum was worth a visit before the climb itself, our boys aged 12 and 15 find all the steps and monkey sightings still as fun as ever! The history, pretty amazing location as well as the views at the top make this a very unique cultural experience, though not for people who have trouble with heights/vertigo...

"We came early in the morning to avoid the crowds, we were there before 7.30am and there were already a few people there, but not too bad. We went up and down in less than 2hs, it was ok, but considering other places in Sri Lanka we thought it as a bit overrated and overpriced (US$30 per person). We also did the rock across, where you only pay 200 rupees and have the same (or a better) view and the climbing is much more fun (and challenging)",2019/01/11,LucianaG69,"Sigiriya, Sri Lanka"

Overpriced (30$per person) but since you are here don't miss it. Lion Rock in Sigiriya is one of the most popular landmarks to visit during aroute through Sri Lanka. The natural phenomenon is an enormous (200m) square shaped rock that looks like it’s placed there.

"Horrible adventure which makes me dissapointed by this country on my last day of Sri Lanka... We wanted to go through there and visit it to go Nuwara Eliya, we arrived there at 4H05PM after 3hours of driving into the mountains, the staff didnt want us to go through cause it says Tickets counter close at 4pm but the park himself closes at 6pm !!! When you check on their website it says close at 6pm... After 45 min to ask them to understand our position that if they can not let us go we will have to drive 2h30 more hours to reach our arrival.. we were about 30 min to reach our destination from horton plains !! The girl in duty call her Officer, 7 people came for us and talk to us like if we were just a piece of s**** and tell us baddly and angry to move the hell from here !!! We were basicly begging them and they were using their power against us in a way I never experienced before. I am not the guy who used to put bad reviews at all but this one needed to be known for everyone ! Make sure if you go nuwara eliya from Ella in car, that you take the right timing. Don't waste your time and money, the suroundings are much more nicer for free. The price fee is also super high for that short parc and foggy place.",2019/01/11,Fullbit,"Bordeaux, France"

A relative strenuous climb if you are not fit. A lot of steep steps and some rough patches to negotiate. A lot of people of all ages climb and you have to wait for people coming down or up as not a lot of passing room. Views from the top well worth the effort.

"We walked up the Peak at around midday (not ideal temperatures but it wasn’t too bad) it’s really well signposted and I’d say the first half of it is a concrete road, so nice and easy. The other half is dirt road through some tea fields with a few rocks and tree roots here and there. Most of the time you’ll spend staring over the valley at Ella Rock. The views all the way up this walk are stunning. I’d say the final 10% of the walk is the toughest, it’s just loads of steep steps up the rock face. It’s not terrible but I think the midday heat made that last part a bit of a grind. It was all worth it when we got to the top though. Views are breathtaking and the cool breeze sorted us right out.",2019/01/11,Wipeitonthecat,"South Devon, United Kingdom"

"I cannot indict such a vital natural wonder as the Yala ecosystem itself, but I also want people to know how disastrously people are mishandling this national treasure. My experience is based on having visited comparable ""safari"" sites at Wilpattu and Udawalawe National Parks in Sri Lanka, Tortuguero in Costa Rica, Khao Yai National Park in Thailand, and Denali in Alaska. In comparison to all of those experiences, Yala is grim as hell.400 safari trucks per day are allowed into Yala. Want to know what that looks like? The opening of a formula-1 race track. Trucks line up before dawn in row upon row, then blast into the park at top speed kicking up clouds of dust in order to hit a small array of scenic picture locations where the drivers know there will be animals wandering about at dawn. At that point, every truck will stop for 90 seconds and allow passengers to get pictures of a single elephant from 300 meters away, and proceed on to the next station of the ecotourism cross.Guess what: the animals have adapted to deal with this idiocy, and they do so by just wandering into the portions of the park which are off-limits to human traffic. As such, compared to other national parks Yala is a silent wasteland. After Wilpattu and Udawalawe we were used to seeing birds everywhere, not to mention deer, jackals, and those giant blue beetles. In Yala, if you're able to find a quiet moment on one of the smaller trails, you can pause and hear...nothing. The animals are gone. They want nothing to due with this mayhem. If you see any vertebrate life form that is an exception to the rule, you're going to be seeing it from a vast difference, and you'll be sharing the view with 500 other tourists.The tragedy here is that Sri Lanka has done an *excellent* job of maintaining its national parks, and I think the ecotourism here is comparable to gold standards like Costa Rica. But to maintain this natural beauty, Yala feels like the sacrificial lamb on the altar of mass market tourism: the other parks remain quiet and vibrant with nature, while Yala drowns in tourists who will only see a single Sri Lankan park, then write generic reviews about the magnificence of a place where they *might* have seen a leopard lazing in a tree, or a single elephant eating grass from a kilometer away, then these reviews help burnish Sri Lanka's well-deserved reputation for ecological stewardship.That said, maybe this is all for the best: Yala has five blocs, and only one or two is open to the public at once. The rest are for the wildlife, and the entrance fees for the done-to-death open portion to the park help keep the leopards, elephants, sloth bears and ungulates preserved in the wild parts of Yala that mercifully no tourist will ever see.",2019/01/10,Bryce A,

I knocked the rating down a peg because of the price - not really worth 660 LKR.

"I’m not typically a beach person, I find the more popular beaches to be much the same around the world (packed full of overpriced bars/restaurants etc) but there are some amazing things that set this beach apart from the rest. We headed down to the beach around 8am with the hope of seeing a wild giant sea turtle feeding and we were lucky enough to find one! This was one of our main hopes for this trip as we love animals. There were a couple of people there already and shortly after there were more and more people but they all seemed to be respectful and gave the turtle space to do as it pleased. There are some officials who “police” the area so they would stop anyone from touching the turtle etc. Having been amazed by the turtle we then used our own snorkel in the shallows and it was full of various fish and other marine life , there were plenty of people offering snorkel tours to a close by rock (by boat) which we may do tomorrow. We walked up the beach and stopped at a place for some breakfast, it was average but we just needed to eat something. There’s plenty of choice for food but I’ve found that the better places are a short walk inland from the seafront. We went back to our room to top up our sun cream and headed back to the beach where we had a drink in the shade before renting some body boards and having some fun in the waves! The waves are very strong so I would not let children play in the sea without an accompanying adult!Although I’m not a fan of beaches in general I found it was rich in marine life which was incredible to see and the body boards were 300 rupees each for an hour which seemed like good value.",2019/01/08,88UK,"Colchester, United Kingdom"

"Came here on the train from Mirissa having heard good things. Instantly disappointed. Outside our hotel, that’s another review in itself, Coral Sands hotel (a relic of a bygone era with some relics still coming to holiday each year).Hikkaduwa beach is littered with rubbish and the water in some parts is full of boats so it makes it very difficult to swim. The beach front itself is littered with beach bars most of which are terribly overpriced and people constantly try to sell you either clothes or other trinkets when you are trying to relax. The atmosphere on the beach is nowhere near as chilled as Mirissa. Another horrific experience was watching people poking and prodding the sea turtles. Leave the bloody things alone!!!There are plenty of dive resorts and surf schools too but be cautious. I scuba dive in Ireland and looked at two schools, would not go near them. Old tatty BCDs, dirty regulators and old boats. Nah cheers mate!The surf schools will rent you a board no problem but don’t expect much from them in terms of a surf report, we just got told “um yes loads of waves”. Nothing about reefs, rips of good spots. Also be cautious of local surfers, they have a tendency to drop in on you even if you have caught the wave.We were told by a surf school “no rocks all sand” but my girlfriend was wiped out and hit her foot on a shallow reef. Now I knew about the reef but the guy in the school assured me, “not to worry, very deep”. Not knowing the topography of the sea I expected the school to inform me having never surfed the area before.  In short if you have been to Mirissa before here or are planning to go to Mirissa before Hikkaduwa then stay away. In classic Irish terms “this place is a bleedin’ Kip!!!”",2019/01/08,stephencomiskey87,"Dublin, Ireland"
"We arrived at 7.15 am, we had seen pictures of long queues which were not for us. By arriving early we went straight to the ticket desk, it was still cool for the climb, there was no cloud so the view was clear, there were few people about so we could take the long path to the rock and take pictures undisturbed. The climb itself was only a small challenge, the view from the top was fabulous looking down on the gardens and further afield across the jungle. We had not realised the size of the buildings/ruins at the top and the enormity of what had been here.There were small caves to see on the way out, monkeys everywhere, small craft and drink stalls who were very pleasant and not pushy.

"This rock is the main attraction of Sigiriya, which houses ancient palace ruins atop a hill - the lion rock. There are about 1250 steps and would take about 1.5 hours to reach the top. The climb is worth it. The ticket price may make you think again, but should go for the climb. Also read along the technology that they had to get the water atop.

"This is a marvelous site, however I was not able to climb to the top.There are just too many locals who insist on helping you ( for income ) up the steps that it is overpowering.

"Horton Plains with Worlds End is one of the ""musts"" when visiting Nuwara Eliya, and it´s worth the effort. Worlds End cliff is enchanting with the drop of +800 meters, but you have to be there before the mist sets in (before 9.00am.?) or else you will meet the white wall instead of the magnificent views.",2019/01/08,andersell,"Tyreso, Sweden"
"We hadn't planned to head up to the Horton Plains before we got to Nuwara Eliya, but decided to on arrival and arranged an early pickup (5am) with our tuktuk driver. Nuwara Eliya is cold at that time of day,and we were very grateful for our padded jackets - make sure you prep well for a cold morning! The journey over in the dark was, well, interesting - low-lying mist on the unlit roads, speeding drivers trying to overtake at all opportunities (it is Sri Lanka after all!) and low powered tuktuk lights all made for a memorable trip! After buying our entry tickets ($45 for two people including all fees and taxes) we headed up to the trail head as the sun was coming up, with a few scattered deer out on the plains - fairly magical! The hike itself is a circular, so you can head either clockwise or anticlockwise - most guides say to go anticlockwise, as you reach Little World's End before World's End but we opted for the latter and didn't regret it at all - it's slightly easier as you get a flattish finish, and you also avoid most of the crowds - once we'd headed out the only people we saw for the first 4km or so were the quicker hikers heading past us (not sure why, this is the sort of place that deserves you take your time to soak in the atmosphere!) The early start was a killer at 4.30am, but seemed like a great idea now - the light is beautiful at that time of day and there's still the early morning frost on the ground and low-lying mist in the valleys. Baker Falls are nice (but no Iguazu!) and the views from World's End and it's little brother are great, but for me the real winner was the hike and the scenery - just magical at that time of day, and we felt at times we were no longer in Sri Lanka but maybe south America! While we didn't see much wildlife on the outward part of the hike we saw quite a bit when heading back after Little World's End - a couple of giant squirrels and a few purple-faced leaf monkeys enjoying a feed in the early morning sun - plus quite a few birds. The round trip is around 9km or so, but we took our time enjoying the journey. Very highly recommended if you're in Nuwara Eliya - indeed, probably the best thing you can do here IMO!",2019/01/08,diveboard_man,"Leeds, United Kingdom"

"Galle was on my to-do list as it’s pretty unique and only a slight detour on our route. We planned to spend a few hours here to walk around, take it in and grab some lunch. It’s a protected site so residents must maintain their property but cannot redevelop it outside of keeping which gives the place some charm. You can walk around the fort wall which offers some great sights and the inner streets are nice too. There are a lot of Italian restaurants and “samey” shops (a lot of gem sellers) which was a little disappointing but this is one of the main tourist attractions in the South so is expected. There are still good and reasonably priced places to eat if you check trip advisor so this was a massive positive for such an area. Well worth the visit, I wouldn’t stay here personally as a few hours was all that was needed.",2019/01/08,88UK,"Colchester, United Kingdom"

"I think we had been spoiled as we travelled around central Sri Lanka before getting to the South coast and were treated by fairly untouched natural beauty but Mirissa seems to have been developed for a foreign crowd which made it similar to many other nice beaches in countries around the world. By this I mean the beach has a lot of bars serving overpriced, average food and drinks and has chairs/sunloungers scattered across it. There is still plenty of sand to make your own and the water is lovely. It is very wavy which is fun to play in but if you have kids I would keep a close eye on them and make sure they are capable before letting them loose. If you are in Mirissa then definitely visit the beach, if you were heading there for the beach and prefer something a bit quieter or untouched then maybe look at some other lesser known places along the coast.",2019/01/08,88UK,"Colchester, United Kingdom"

Wednesday are particular busy with hundreds of locals bringing offerings and having special services. It was very atmospheric and almost Claustrophic with some many people moving at a shuffle up the stairs and through - and don't expect to see the tooth!!

Hikkaduwa beach is an amazing place to relax and enjoy life. It’s a very wide beach with big waves and surfers riding them every day.

Not recommended if you have mobility problems or vertigo as the stairway is steep, slippery (especially if it is raining) and feels quite precarious in places.

As you climb, look at some of the footholds carved into the steep rock and marvel at the inventiveness, skill and bravery of the builders of this monument.

They must make the entrance fees reasonable allow discounts for seniors, students etc.You enter the ground and see the palace rock garden and then you begin your steep ascent to the top. Along the way you will see a cave with paintings, the mirror wall with inscriptions and the lion claw entrance.

"As I didn’t find enough instructions and what to expect while searching I thought of writing the review with all the details included which I got to know from our guide and I assume it will help the future travelers. Excuse for this long review though. The best time to visit this rain forest is during January - Mid of April. If you’re interested in birdwatching it’s better to start at 6.00 a.m (Opens at 6.00a.m) but as the birds fly up very high and tiny you’d need good cameras to capture them. If not for that starting at 8.00a.m would be fine where again you will hear bird tweets but hardly seen. Luckily I saw a few endemic birds although I started at 8 o’clock. There are various types of treks that you can take according to your wish. Treks for around 3 hrs, 5hrs and even longer ones with around 19km which takes almost a day (8a.m.-5p.m) There are 4 entrances to the forest from different towns. I accessed through Mediripitiya, Deniyaya. The guides doesn’t necessarily have to be pre booked as they can be called near to the entrance. There is no particular guide fee but it’s better to tip them with a little more money. The vehicles can’t go up to the entrance, so you will have to take tuk tuks and the guides can be helpful in here. (Might cost around 250LKR for tuks and also walkable as it’s around a 1.5km) About the clothing; It’s up to you to wear either shorts or long pants but it’s said it’s better with short because any leaches or insects can be spotted easily. Good trekking or walking shoes are recommended as it would be better for walking while it’s slippery as well. Better to take some snacks and food along with you where you can sit and enjoy them during the trek and also enough water. So here I come to say what to actually expect. Starting with the entrance the ticket is a very small amount for both locals and foreigners which I assume is toooo low.You can see various types of endemic species and plants, birds, lizards, snails, snakes, butterflies, millipedes and little types of insects. There are 3 elephants and all the kinds of leopards but are not seen as they do not come close to where the trek is done. The waterfalls are magnificent you can go up in there and enjoy a free fish therapy and also dip yourself in fresh water which is highly recommended. The walking path is where the people of other closer villages pass by so motor bikes are also crossed. The high trees and trekking paths are just too gorgeous to explain. You will feel the inner peace when you walk and feel the nature for sure. Leaches: The most concern of all. It’s not very harmful at the first place but you can hire leach socks (ask about it at the entrance)but as our guide said a packet of salt will do good enough. That is to apply the table salt on your shoes. I was very lucky to find no leach in my shoes or legs but it is mainly because it didn’t rain much on the previous days but if it rained there will be more leaches. If you’re too concerned apply some insect repellents as well.  PS: Everyone can’t expect the same types of insects or snakes to be seen as it differ with the climate and other various factors. I would highly recommend this place if you are truly a nature lover.",2019/01/07,senjay97,"Nuwara Eliya, Sri Lanka"
"Although we had a great time here and saw lots of wildlife, including snakes beware of the scams. Here's what happened to us and we had an organised driver, who I actually didn't always trust unfortunately. He tried to tell us we needed to find a guide prior to the entrance, so I gave up arguing and simply caught Tuk Tuk up to entrance. When we arrived I was wary, pretty sure it wasn't the official entrance so just played the game. The man who approached us wanted 2600SR per person, husband butted in and said yeh ok I just kept my trap shut at that point. Then we started walking off so I kept asking where is the official entrance I want a receipt. He kept saying it's up ahead, and yes we finally did get there. We then had to pay approx 550SR each entrance. I knew this was right but had to sought out the rest. I queried the lady at desk and said don't we pay for an official guide here after taking a photo of the entrance, she then looked blankly at our supposed guide then asked ME how much, I replied I'd read that it was 1000SR which she then agreed to. Well surprise surprise then an official guide materialised. You could then tell the difference the official guide had a Polo shirt with the appropriate logos and our so called guide had a T-shirt printed up to look identical. We did our 3hr walk to the waterfall and back, as we only wanted to do the short trek and we did have a great time for a few 1000 SR cheaper than they tried to fleece us and we gave him a tip. My warning is when you get dropped off at house at top hill continue walking down hill to official gate. We will never know if I didn't demand that we go to gate and buy a ticket whether we would have ended up on some random walk somewhere as I have read has happened to others.",2019/01/07,gypsyrocket333,"Mackay, Australia"

"This was the third of three 'safaris' I took in Sri Lanka. i did consider cancelling this tour as i had concerns about volume of vehicles and people in the park based on earlier reviews, but it really wasn't a problem once we were inside the park: it seems each driver has his own favourite route and areas for spotting various species. This tour was the best for elephant watching as we saw a few elephant family groups close up. The leopards were elusive, but the birdlife prolific, along with buffalo, deer, wild boar, and crocodiles. The scenery around the lakes and along the coastline is also quite interesting. it is worthwhile bringing a good camera and lenses if you can be bothered carrying them for the rest of your travels - the phone camera just doesn't work, especially for birds. There is a sobering memorial for those who lost their lives in the 2004 tsunami: a reminder that we are always at the mercy of the elements.

The view from the top, over towards Ella Rock, is nice! There's also another additional section to an alternative viewing point further on - this is a little bit more technical so I'd only recommend this if you've got a decent pair of shoes on (I saw way too many folks slipping and sliding over the rocks in their gripless footwear!). You can also couple this hike with the 9 Arch Bridge by carrying along Passara Road and dropping down to the bridge - come back via the railway line for a nice 10km or so circular.",2019/01/07,diveboard_man,"Leeds, United Kingdom"

The line to the left, is the line to walk past the door, that holds the Buddha's tooth. The door is open for a few minutes and then closed for about 30 minutes..making it a long wait time.

"The safari lasted from 6am - 3.30pm. Yala covers about 1000 sqKm, about the size of Luxembourg. You can see e.g. elephants, water buffaloes, peacocks and if you are lucky a leopard. I observed some problems during my visit. Problem 1: There are to many jeeps on to little space. Some jeeps, which can accomodate 6 persons, only went with 1 or 2. Altogether the number of jeeps (and people?) in Yala seems to be to high. Problem 2: The search for the photo highlight leopard was nothing else than a hunt. The whole visit is mainly focused on that - if you do not find the leopard you failed. This is why the drivers desperately try to fulfil the tourists desire. Informed by mobile phone our jeep rushed, among others, suddenly with very high speed (official limit 25km/h) to a place where a leopard was spotted. A lot of dust and diesel exhaust you get for free. Problem 3: After the 3rd high speed trial we found a leopard in the afternoon. About 15-20 jeeps jammed in front of the leopard (approx. 20 meters) who had a rest in the shade of a tree. Constantly running engines and other noise finally forced the shy animal after a few minutes to leave. Finally, I did not see any information centre, e.g. to give details about the endangered species in the parc. That is why I cannot recommend to visit Yala under these conditions.",2019/01/06,BP500,"Berlin, Germany"

"From my Blog:After paying the 300 entry fee, and taking a small back path to avoid the ‘guides’ I made the fantastic decision of splurging on a 30 rupee 2 litre bottle of water.As I approached the rock my decision poved to be the correct one. It was a steep climb up, and there were no vendors on the way up.If you have issues with heights or shoddy-looking scaffolding, this climb is not for you. You begin the climb by going up steps cut in rock. It begins simply enough, a quick ascent, an opportunity to take photo’s, followed by another quick ascent.With the correct stamina you can get about a quarter of the way up the climb in 10-15 minutes. When you get to the top of the first set of stairs there is a giant spiral staircase bolted to the side of the rock which leads to the first of the caves. This spiral-case is bolted to the side of the rock, and is absolutely not recommended for those afraid of heights.As you ascend the case you absolutely feel as if you are protruding from the side of the rock face. Though it does not feel unsafe by any means, as you ascend and look back at how high up the rock you are, it can be a fairly unnerving experience.At the top of the stairs is a cave with some of the most intricate paintings I’d seen so far on my trip. The great care taken in these paintings, coupled with just how much effort was required in scaling this rock pre-modern times, made for a quite awesome experience.I began to take pictures, but soon noticed a wet trail leading to the entrance of the cave. I walked to the entrance and saw the trail going down the stairs. Putting ‘two and two’ together it became apparent this was my own trail of sweat, and it could be followed like a trail of breadcrumbs all the way to the base of the rock. I took in a half litre of water in what felt like two gulps, thanked the guards for avoiding getting in any pictures, and was soon descending the spiral stair-case back to the main scaffolding toward the top of the rock.At the bottom of the stairs, I glanced at the trail back, thankful my sweat trail was beginning to evaporate in the heat of the day.I walked along the pathway flanking the front and side of the rock and approached the next set of steps. These steps were actually carved into the rock and though the depth and width of the steps was doable, the height of each step created a situation where its just small enough to make going one step at a time awkward, but just big enough that you can’t sustain taking two steps at a time for an extended period of time.After a period of one/two stepping I’d finally made it to the base of the Citadel of sigiriya and the name ‘Lion rock’ became obviousAfter waiting for 10 minutes for the oblivious Chinese tourists to stop sitting on the rocks people were trying to take photo’s of, I snapped a few quick pictures myself and began the climb up the final ascent to the top.Lucky for me, they’d laid metal steps over the carved steps, making for a slightly easier experience climbing up.The excitement I felt upon ‘conquering’ this climb was soon quelled when a woman in her mid to late 70’s came climbing up shortly after I arrived. Though I’d made it up fairly quickly and easily, I had to take my hat off to the slow and steady pace she’d employed in her successful ascent to the Citadel.Lucky for me, there were only a handful of folks at the top of the temple, some of whom were striking yoga poses at the top-most point of the rock.I sat there in the sun, sweat dripping off my face, taking the epic 360 degree view in, remembering just how privileged I was to be where I was, doing what I was doing, as carefree as you like.",2019/01/05,yellingfore,"London, United Kingdom"

"I think the more I go on these organised safaris, be it Wales, Yarla or otherwise, I get a further feeling of sadness. Don't get me wrong, the park is beautiful, the jeep bouncing at breakneck speed over the unmade roads equals the unequivocal excitement when the call comes in to say that there has been a leopard sighting. However, the crowding, the poorly maintained vehicles belching fumes and kicking up dust as they force their way down a narrow stretch of track to peer blindly into the Bush, to a throng of horns and shouting from frustrated drivers, soon kills the moment. I am no naturalist, so cannot profess to be an expert, but surely these dim witted, heavy footed jeep drivers can begin to work out that these wild animals will simply bugger off through fear or loathing at being oggled at by a thousand tourists in their stinking Toyotas, hovering parasitically around their lunch spot. There needs to be some more structure, the queues of traffic were equal to Londons South Circular on a busy rush hour. Drivers heading down the wrong side of the road to try and jump the tailback, all be it to give their riders a better chance I except, but ultimately further adding to the pandemonium. A system needs to be implemented to improve the park, the quality of life for the residents and indeed the tourists.As I say, beautiful park, but the sight of 30 jeeps, complete with screaming horns and drivers, hemming a young bull elephant in between them and the river it was trying to drink from is not acceptable, and at that point I asked to go home.",2019/01/04,epj123,"London, United Kingdom"

"Living here for two years I can't believe we have never done this before! It HAS TO be on your bucket list of you're outdoorsy, adventurous or just enjoy beauty in nature. We left Newara Eliya at 5am and paid and entered the park by 7am. The entire walk took us 3 hours and was stunning. You walk through so many different terrains and get to see stunning sights. I even saw families with young children managing the walk. You can choose to go right or left at the Y-bend after entering on the walk. We went left, which takes you to little world's end, then on to world's end and finally the falls. But you can go right and switch the order. I think we choose well as returning by the left route may be more difficult than via the right. Look out for the clouds covering the valley as you drive up the mountain.

"This park, in my opinion, was as enjoyable as the African parks. We did a two-day trip in this park, starting 4am & staying until around 5.30 - 6.00pm. We hired a vehicle for the two of us & the driver was useful & acted as a guide too. We managed to see leopards, sloth bear, Ceylon spotted dear, mugger crocodiles, boars, ruddy mongooses, black-necked hares, langurs, elephants & numerous species of birds (big & small). Although many cars were waiting at entrance gate, very few were seen once inside. Excellent experience & highly recommended.

Bouncy does not describe the journey through the park, I thought I was Tigger , bouncy wouncey fun fun fun fun fun. Loads to see and guide was great at spotting things that were very difficult to see even when pointed at. Leopards were not on the agenda today but hey that’s what it’s all about if you seen them every trip they wouldn’t be elusive would they.

"You don't have to pay any entrance fee to enjoy Galle Fort :)It's a nice walk along the wall, and it's all connected. You can walk from one end all the way to the beach and viewpoint area. It's amazing how the fort is standing for so long through history.There's an area where there is a huge drop, sadly there are a lot of rubbish thrown down there. It's a pity how people can fail to help maintain things.There's a small beach but crowded with people. Walk further up and you will see sort of like a Viewpoint, also crowded with people. Before the viewpoint there is an area not too big almost nobody (think it's opposite the white mosque). We sat there with our legs hanging over the cliff while waiting for the sunset. It's a very high fall but doesn't seem like it in the picture I attached. It was amazing, peaceful and windy. Our enjoyment was short-lived as people began flocking to the spot we were at and started taking pictures. Do make sure u check out the fort at least once, I think it's worth taking the time.",2019/01/03,carynjen13,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"

You could skip the preface and get a tuktuk to the bottom but it wouldn’t be as fun!There is some development going on at the moment and it looks like there will soon be a cable car, I may be mistaken though. The walk was easy, there were plenty of families with kids and the views from the top were spectacular! There are two peaks and a third a short hike away too, it wasn’t busy and best of all it is free!

The facade is beautiful, the interiors not so well maintained. The history of the tooth relic is depicted through paintings which is quite fascinating. Spoiler: even if you visit during the puja timings, you can only see the golden casket in which the tooth is stored, from a few feet - they never take the tooth out.",2019/01/03,abhipsita,"Mumbai, India"
"Wow, this was a pretty amazing and full on experience which I wasn't prepared for. The throngs of worshippers that come here can be a little overwhelming especially once the doors open for the tooth relic (as other have mentioned you don't see the tooth, it is enclosed in a gold casket which itself is rather spectacular). The crowds that surge forward is not unlike being in a mosh pit at a concert - and great to be caught up in it all. Teh temple itself is pretty stunning and you can easily spend quite a bit of time here esp. if you're here during on of the ceremonies and happy to line up for a closer look at the casket that holds the tooth.

"By the time we visited here we were a little “tempted out” but so glad we made the effort and went.Be prepared to take your shoes off and walk barefoot for a few hours as you visit the temple. Also wear trousers and no hats. There was a lot of pushing and shuffling in the queue, partly because we came at the same time as the ceremony was about to start! This was fine as we had been used to this elsewhere. Once inside, OMG it was incredible. The temple itself along with the main area where the tooth relic is kept are so ornate it’s hard to describe. I don’t like taking pictures inside any religious building so we truly took in the smaller details that those who were viewing behind their cameras may not have seen. On entering the temple I overheard one person say “what do you mean we can’t take photos? What’s the point in going in?” To me the point is to go in and respect the building for the religious purpose it has. We saw incredible detail on the drawings, paintings, carvings etc. An incredible experience and certainly a must do.If you come prepared for the pushing and craziness of the place you will enjoy it more and I challenge you to not take any photos inside.",2019/01/03,bowenqs,"Darrington, United Kingdom"

We started early getting there for 7am and actually it wasn't very crowded at all at that time and it was find going up and down. we took our time at the top although it was starting to get pretty busy as we were leaving.

My guide told me that the walk had to be done before 9am otherwise I wouldn’t be able to see anything due to the mists. Judging by the number of people walking back when I started the trek, their guides had told them the same thing! The walk itself was challenging but totally worth it for the views. The mists had indeed settled when I reached world’s end but a bit of patience and I was able to get the amazing views. There’s lots of native fauna to be seen on the way, keep an ear out for the monkeys. Tip: most people turn left to reach little world’s end first, I went straight to get to baker’s falls first.

"The next place in the list is again a city that is popular for the temples. You could easily spend your day imagining the ancient city life at the ruins of Polonnaruwa. Well preserved and full of archaeological treasures with hundreds of ancient structures like tombs and temples, statues and stupas it is difficult to not be amazed by the ruins here. This is known to everyone that Sri Lanka is the country of temples and also it has many monuments and heritages that depict its history and culture. Polonnaruwa is one such place that is very popular among the tourists and one will get to experience the real life of Sri Lanka here.

So, if you are a spiritual person and also you have an interest in knowing the history, culture, and tradition of different countries, then you must visit this place. This place will give you the exact glimpses of Sri Lanka history and culture. One would wonder as what are the things here, which will give the sneak peek of the Sri Lankan history? The answer to this question is that there are the remains of the old buildings and monuments that were once standing here",2019/01/01,traveltriangle,

"£50 to climb and locals pay way less.

So we booked this through our hotel in Colombo which after paying for told us it would cost us 7000 to climb the rock. Bearing in mind it took us 7 1/2 in traffic because the drive crazy no rules .We arrived at the rock after 3:5 hour drive to be met by chaotic scenes. Absolutely no structure or proper set up. When we arrived the rude cashier attendant told us it would cost us 10800 over £50 to climb the rock. This was the start of the scam. Locals pay wait less bot £ 2 to climb it and they have a different cashier. No prices are on display . We got to the stairs and it was crazy no staff controlling the people and no care for people’s safety.We met a nice American couple who advise us t get a guide as the queues where mental.We paid 6000 extra and he took us up the right hand side steps. Not too difficult a climb as we are not the most active 3 steep stairs where you can rest at the top.The one or two staff working knew our guide and he pushed in and was allowed pass the queues again he’s probably getting a cut too.We got to the top and there is not much up there as it’s ruins with no information. View was very nice picture moment.Our guide rushed us through and we began our descent. He again pushed in and was allowed by staff. We where told it took 4 hours by couple who queued. We did it in less than 2 hours.There is no where near enough staff to deal with so many people and I feel it’s only a matter of time before their is a serious incident.No real regard for people’s safety and I know in other countries it would not be allowed.If you don’t want to pay guide go to the right hand side steps .It was a nice but felt like everyone was trying to catch people out. Bring plenty of water or you can pick up some in stalls at bottom.,2018/12/31,barneygumble06,"London, United Kingdom"
"It has amazing places to visit and hundreds of cafes , restaurants and bars and shops for tourists. Visiting the places in the Galle Fort is so mind relaxing because it looks like something which is not from 21st Century but its still here for us to visit and admire the place. Every time i visit Galle i never forget to have a walk at the Galle Fort.The history of Galle extends thousands of years to biblical times. In more recent times it was a prize to be possessed for western traders in search of wealth and glory. Its beautifully preserved colonial Dutch fort with its quaint city with cobblestone streets within is a place time forgot. Close by are magnificent beaches, rainforests and other attractions. It is definitely a fascinating place to visit.",2018/12/31,don_rukshan,"Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia, Sri Lanka"

"It’s a easy gradient walk until the very end when it’s about 10 minutes of steep stairs. The view at the top makes up for it. I went in the evening intending to see the sun set. By the time I reached the top, it had become cloudy and breezy. The visibility was quite limited because of the clouds but sitting in the middle of the clouds looking at the tea plantations was an experience in itself. There were just 10-15 people walking up to the peak so crowd wise it was very peaceful. Few recommendations : 1. for the best view, visit there early in the morning. 2. Hike to all the three peaks 3.

"This was one of my favorite things that we did in Ella. If we were staying longer, I would have done it again! We went up around 9AM, and it was starting to get crowded. It was an easy hike to the first peak, but if you go further it gets a little steeper. I would definitely recommend to wear athletic shoes if you plan on doing that. I saw a lot of people coming back holding their sandals in their hands. Once we reached the first view point, we went to the next peak, which was still a bit crowded. We went on to another one and there was hardly anyone there! So it was nice to sit there in the quiet and enjoy the views. The trails are marked really well, so it was not hard to find.

Having travelled to a number of other temples and sites in Sri Lanka this was a real let down and just over priced and difficult to enter. Tickets for internationals now use automated machines that don’t like new bank notes - so after 10 minutes and some note swaps we were able to buy our tickets. Like most locations internationals have a place to secure their shoes which requires a donations (locals are free and don’t try and use the local one as they tell you no) - not much to the temple and as others have reviewed it’s crowded and you can not see the tooth. For any one unfortunate to use a local guide be careful - one quoted us euro 50 to take us through - fortunately we have developed the best guide request answer for temples - NO ... overall it feels like a rip off with little to see and additional entrances fees ...,2018/12/31,Roztrav,"Sydney, Australia"
We were planning on going here but decided not to after we got yelled at for just walking in front of it. There is a road in front of it that went from town to our hotel that had tons of people walking on it.

It was an amazing experience and safe for even non-swimmers. There are hundreds of varieties of fish that literally swim by you, unforgettable experience. Costed about 3000lkr per head.

"Having arrived later afternoon we were able to climb the rock and enjoy the late afternoon views ... like other reviewers have noted this is definitely not a climb for the faint hearted as in parts the stairs claws into the rock to get you to the top. Also like others we had a guide thrust upon us - we were fortunate to only have to pay 3,000 LKR after reading about fees of around 1,500 LKR and did so to get him to go away ... his commentary was not that great and we of course were shown the shortcuts (including a couple where his mates were selling items) ... a great day and expensive ... but fun ... be brave and when the guide starts just say NO ...",2018/12/30,Roztrav,"Sydney, Australia"

Essential that you get there before 7:30am. Do not attempt if you have the faintest hint of vertigo as the stairs literally hang on to the rocks. There is lots to see and it was very interesting. I had already read a brief history of the rock and palace which the guide just repeated. At the end of the tour he demanded 11,000LKR or US$50. Which was clearly a total rip off. We ended up paying him just to get rid of him. Our driver was horrified at what had happened. Totally spoilt our trip here and has made me view the people here quite differently.",2018/12/30,Johnnycash72,"London, United Kingdom"

From the very beginning there were queues and we considered turning back. However it actually moves quite quickly - in spite of the crazy queues it only took 1.5 hours to get up to the top and the slow progress up the steps provided lots of opportunity to take pictures.Take lots of water as it’s quite hot and note there’s no bathroom once you start.The views are spectacular.

"Sri Lanka is a beautiful country, but sadly Yala is an experience you should most definitely skip. When you have to wait 30 minutes at the gate to get in having woken up at 5:30am you know something is not quite right. From there it is a procession of 200 jeeps along a bumpy dust road with the only real attractions being some buffalos, peacocks and the occasional elephant. At one stage a leopard was rumoured to be sighted but the guides all radio each other so you have almost zero chance of seeing it as it has long gone due to the noise of the jeeps by the time the 200 jeep cavalry arrives at the same spot. Minnieriya was a much better experience all round, as I would imagine most other national parks in Sri Lanka would be. Nobody in the other jeeps looked remotely happy either.

"We have just returned from our walk up Sigiriya. We arrived just after 8am thinking that would be early enough to avoid the queues....but not quite! Tickets for foreigners cost 30 USD per adult and 15 USD for children under 12. Tickets must be paid for in cash. There is an ATM about 5 minutes walk away. We waited in line for about 45 minutes for tickets. Depending on your circumstances - it may be worth sending someone (eg a driver) ahead for tickets. The line to start the climb was long and fairly slow moving which was a real challenge in the heat / humidity. We were probably in the line for about 30 minutes before taking up the offer of a ‘shortcut’ from a local, for a price of course. We ended up rejoining the line further up which was still fairly slow moving and pretty warm. There was one area that had some lovely frescos. Eventually we made it to the top and enjoyed the view. The walk down took a little bit of time as well as you share the stairs with people heading up. Watch out for the monkeys on the way up and down - they will grab any snacks within reach.

"Went in the evening during the ceremony, with children ages nine and 12. It was extremely overcrowded and the entrance fee was fairly steep. Then once you go inside you have to pay another fee to leave your shoes. What we did not know is that the tooth is not visible, it is encased in seven layers of an egg shaped protection device. It is only visible one or two times per year. The Buddhist temple in Colombo is much better and more peaceful, and much smaller. There are beautiful views outside of the temple of the lake end of the big Buddha statue on the mountain which is lit up at night.",2018/12/29,shopaddict,"Dallas, Texas"

This holy place houses Buddha’s tooth. There is a history behind how the tooth arrived. It is confusing where to put your shoes or even where to go since many locals don’t speak english. When we finally figured out where to store shoes we were told to go pay more at foreigner shoe rack and get a shoe stub ticket. We found where to get foreigner tickets and got a guide hanging around vending machines. This country survives on tourism and tour tourist dollars help pay for sustenance. I read many people quibble about tourist prices but it helps maintain the facility. I will say without this guide’s help we would have been stuck in the massive throng lines for hours. You need to get your ticket punched as you climb up stairs. It does take a good deal of time to navigate but it is incredible to see the workmanship in temple and the lovely flowers being offered and small babies being blessed. The sacred tooth is behind doors and hard to get to see due to the gold encasement surrounding it and it is held behind doors and only opened at scheduled times. The public pushes to get close and we were smothered by bodies trying to get a close look. Apparently in August the tooth is shown to public. Hire a guide. You can haggle over price first and pay after the tour is done. Well worth visit to experience Buddhist holy place.,2018/12/29,horsecourse,"Boise, Idaho"
"As we heard the buddhist chanting, we were drawn to the temple at sunset time. Before you go a few tips: wear long trousers or skirt and cover your shoulders (otherwise you will have to buy something in a shop near the temple), bring a bag in which you can put your shoes (otherwise you will have to queue to get them put into a large pile of shoes) and bring the exact change to buy your ticket (1,500 per person for foreigners). At first, all of these things really annoyed me as we came unprepared, but there was such a calming and spiritual atmosphere in and around the temple, that we loved it and ended up spending two hours there.",2018/12/29,christinaf695,"Yokohama, Japan"

$30 US per person to climb the hill is extortionately expensive comparative to what the locals pay as well as general costs for other things in the area such as food and accommodation. To put into perspective it would have cost us more to climb this thing than the two nights we stayed in a local guest house. There is another similar climb nearby that is only 500 LKR per adult.

"Where do I begin, to tell the story of Sangiriya tourist sight of Sri Lanka. Famed for its remarkable views and history, it is a place about 80km from Kandy, which sounds pretty near but takes about 3-4 hours by car to get there as the average pace through the towns between is 10-30km/hr. If one were to arrive at the sight before 9am, this would be the only way to avoid a 2 hour long que moving at snail pace to somehow get to what you think is the top, but in fact is just a way to slow down the entire journey. After reaching this half way point, you again have to stand in a que for about 30mins - 1 hour to get to the top view point. Which would be great if that was all the waiting to be done, but then after seeing a pretty average view, you will need to wait yet another queue to get back down to the bottom for another 30mins-1hour. Now this would all be ok if it is not above 33 degree Celsius weather in a spot with literally no personal space, packed like sardines with some who have negotiable hygiene standards, and with kids and grandmothers alike trying to climb this fashionably steep set of stairs all the way up and down, often holding the queue’s at a standstill with their families trying to convince them to take another step forward. So for those who think that this will be an adventure of a lifetime, think again...be prepared for hours of standing in a tightly packed queue for hours on end, in the heat, for a very average view of trees and couple of lakes. If you don’t believe me, see the photos below. If you insist on visiting this spot my advice would be to go at 8am which would require you to leave kandy or Colombo at 5am at the very latest or just find a place to stay near by the night before. Otherwise plan for an entire day on the road in traffic and in queues.",2018/12/28,NikSin,

Go to Pidurangala as early as 5:30am (opening hours); and4. Visit Sigiriya right after Pidurangala on the same day (make sure before 8am)5. Avoid weekend or public holidays.

Plants used in Ayurvedic healing of arthritis, depression, even cancer, and ones which are still sometimes the basis of our western medicines, were frequently spotted.

We reflected on the price of admission and what we received for that and agreed that the $US30 cost is absolutely ridiculous, when you consider the price of entry to natural attractions in other countries and when also taking into account the minimum wage in Sri Lanka is about $US55 per month.

"We did see elephants, we did enjoy the fresh air while driving thru the park in open safari vehicle. This, like ALL safari parks and experiences in Sri Lanka, are woefully overcrowded and suffer from overtourism #overtourism and bad overuse practices. The safari companies and hotels and guesthouses book only ""private"" safaris. So, even if you are a party of 1, you go by yourself in a large jeep that can easily fit 4. If you are a party of 2, you go just you two in a large jeep that can easily fit 4. Make friends at your guesthouse and book a safari for 4. Or, Sri Lanka main National Parks (Yala, Minneriya, Uda Walawe) should match up travelers upon arrival, and have each jeep go full with 4 persons. This would not only save travelers money, but most importantly, help curb overtourism and vehicle crowding in the park(s). Horribly bad as 15 vehicles would stop at the same elephant or animal, wait there for 10+ minutes, then all proceed together, and then all stop again together at the next sighting... awful. As tourism grows in Sri Lanka, it will absolutely destroy the environmental, visual, and aesthetic natural treasures and national parks it has... Hurulu eco Park, Minerya National Park, Yala National Park, Uda Walawe National Park. This could easily be solved by:(a) Combining 4 tourists per jeep.

But there are some things to keep in mind that I've also put on my travel blog:• It’s a safari, not the zoo: your driver will do his best, and communicate with other guides, to find both elephants and leopards if possible• The roads are rough so be prepared for a bumpy ride and hold on tight• You don’t need a hat as every jeep I saw was covered• A dust mask is a good idea; I had one but many people didn’t and were improvising with t-shirt and facial tissue (aka, Kleenex)• Mosquito repellant is a must; there is a LOT of standing water for the animals and, thus, for the mosquitos• You will be covered in red clay dust by the end• And if you do a full day tour, know that it is now a requirement in the park that all jeeps stop driving between 12 and 14.00 so you, and all of the other tourists doing a day tour will hang out near the beach for 2 hours.

The temple has a very rich and interesting history and was facinating to everyone in my group.

"We reached Kandy from Colombo Airport (bypassing Colombo altogether) and went straight to the Temple. Visitors from SAARC countries have a discount on the ticket (1,000 SLR as against 1,500), must have local currency as the ticket is from a machine (does not accept credit cards-normal in Sri Lanka). The ticket entitles you to a souvenir which we realised later forgot to collect There are two entrances to the larger temple complex, with many shrines (including an active one one to a Hindu Goddess). If you do not get off at the main one, it is a five minute walk across some charming shrines, across the main entrance to the ticket counter. The shoe counter for non Sri Lankans is different from that of locals; why one doesn't know as both are free. One can buy an offering of flowers at the entrance; the line can be long and slow, the visual of the Relic is brief",2018/12/26,Kapsb10,"New Delhi, India"
"Sri Dalada Maligawa or the Temple of the sacred Tooth Relic is a Buddhist temple in the city of Kandy, Sri Lanka, located in the royal palace complex of the former Kingdom of Kandy and houses the relic of the tooth of the Buddha. Since ancient times, the relic has played an important role in local politics because it is believed that whoever holds the relic holds the governance of the country. Kandy,the last capital of the Sri Lankan kings and is a world heritage site mainly due to the temple. There is an entry fee of LKR 1500 ( 1000 for visitors from SAARC countries). Footwear and headgear not allowed. After you purchase entry tickets you can deposit footwear at a booth located on the left side of the entrance exclusive for foreigners. A tip of LKR 20 per pair is expected. The dress code requires you to cover the body least up to knee while the upper portion of the dress should cover the shoulders and visitors in shorts and sleeveless tees are allowed to enter the site by covering themselves with clothes available on hire to visitors at the entrance of the temples. If you wearing shorts or you have a dress with open shoulders do not forget to have a scarf with you. You can cover the legs and shoulder as you enter the temple and later take it off.After a visit inside there is a Museum inside which can be visited with the entry tickets and also a Museum of World Buddhism as well.

"We visited this beautiful place recently. But on reaching there, we found that if you are from a SAARC country, you must carry your Original Passport to avail 50% discount for entry ticket. It's steep 30 USD for all foreign visitors. But for SAARC residents it's 15 USD only and only if you produce your original passport at the ticket window. No digital or photocopies would suffice. We didn't know this fact. Eventually we avoided the climb of this 1200 steps and rather took a TukTuk auto rickshaw ride around the periphery which was simply a great fun.

"Ok, so I’ll start out by saying I’m a pretty fit person (triathlete, trail runner). I read all the reviews before going and noticed so many different views from “nice flat and easy” to “really tough”. I ran the route, taking about 1hr 30 (I’m not a quick runner). For someone who doesn’t exercise regularly this would be really tough. But definitely give it a crack. Just know it’s not going to be easy and you need comfortable shoes. Saw so many people out there today in completely inappropriate shoes. I ran clockwise. I’ve read that anticlockwise is easier. Without having run anticlockwise, I think that would probably be right. But I guess it’s a loop. So there’s as much up as there is down, whichever way you go. But it’s so beautiful. I didn’t go with the intent of getting to World’s End before the fog came. Which is good, because I got there at about 10:15 and you couldn’t see a thing. But it’s still well worth doing as there are so many other views.",2018/12/25,ShellyAus,"Melbourne, Australia"

Look out for people who cross on to another peak a little away from Little Adam’s Peak, it’s nearby but requires a little scrambling down and up steep slopes.

I was extremely upset for this. They compare and match their prices with the prices in USA and other Western European countries. What they ignore is the fact that if we charge that amount it is a necessity because we pay the workers a minimum $10 per hour, but they pay theirs around $5 per day. So all the money go to the state, not to the workers.Anyway, the park, the climbing of that big rock, etc. was a unique experience. Make sure you are fit, for it is a lot of climbing.

However, other than that, there is little more to it than a religious shrine/ temple, which in its simplicity is truly beautiful. Entrance for locals is free and 300 rupees for tourists or £1.30 in sterling. Maybe everyone should pay, or everyone should be permitted to enter for free, as we are all equal wherever you are from.

"This is the one ""must see"" places to experience in Kandy (if not all of Sri Lanka). There is a long history behind this temple, and it is the most sacred site in the entire country (which is why there will always be large crowds filing in).We were relatively fortunate to get in without the masses that many experience, so it may be better to go in the morning. We timed it to be inside for the 9:30 am ceremony when they play music and open the doors inside the temple so people can see the alter that holds the relic (a tooth from Lord Buddha).There are other halls within the temple that illustrate some of the history behind the temple.",2018/12/23,moviegeekjn,"Phoenix, Arizona"

"I travelled to Sigiriya with my wife and 2 children during what was supposed to be the dry season in late December. We paid a driver to take us on a 2 hour trip each way from Matale.Bad luck or bad planning but the weather was terrible. There was heavy rain from the moment we arrived until well after we left. There was no view from the top but despite the rain still vast crowds of people climbing up narrow, steep and very slippery stairways. The entrance fee was USD 30 per adult and USD 15 for each child up to age 12 plus the cost of, what seemed like an obligitory guide. The price seemed a bit steep, and maybe I wouldn’t have minded paying this on a better day but I subsequently found out that foreigners pay more than 100x the cost of a ticket for locals. I can understand a tourist mark up but this is outrageous and feels like an institutional rip off!The visit took about 2 hours. Our guide who cost us another USD 20 whisked us up and down fairly quickly pointing out things that were already well signposted.

No pictures allowed in that room though.On exiting the temple, the grounds are very nice with hundreds of candles as well as incense burning!Also more very old buildings.",2018/12/22,CliffS418,"Thornhill, Canada"
"First day we had a look from the outside and thought we would skip the entrance and its fee. Quite bit to see with loads of little stupas, holy trees and Buddha temples. The day after someone told to get in, that it was a must see. And yes, this person was right. I really didn't expect to see that much on the other side. So it is definitely worth it to pay the entrance. A huge temple, smaller ones, museums, one on how budism is represented in each country. Very well done, very big, sadly not many details or descriptions if you want to know more. It is definitely a MUST see in Kandy!",2018/12/22,juliedarmstadt,"Darmstadt, Germany"

"As recommended by all guides, since the grounds open at 7 am, you’d better be there around that time, if you want to enjoy your ascent to the top. Before starting the trek I’d suggest a visit to the museum. At the very least, read the small leaflet which contains all the info you may need. It is astonishing to think that this amazing fortress was actually used for less than 20 years, before being reconverted into a monastery and then abandoned.It is quite a hard trek, so you don’t want to be going up when it’s already hot, not to mention the endless queues of people moving up at at different speed. Once on the top, the view is truly magnificent, as are the ruins of the fortress.Plenty of monkeys around to entertain the tourists. On the way down, you can find drinkable water next to the first aid tent, before the Lion’s Gate. Take your time in the lower garden, some hidden corners are definitely worth seeing.",2018/12/21,Dierregi,"Olhao, Portugal"
"It takes some time to climb the stairs to the top, and can be challenging if travelling with children as we did, but the views are great from the top.

On the way up there are some interesting spots, but not much information available, so guess we were lucky to have a guide with us to explain some things as it made it more interesting.

"Compared to the outstanding Udawalawe National Park, Yala is a massive disappointment. We saw nothing - no leopard, bear, elephant... not even a monkey. I get that the leopard sightings can be hit and miss but there is no back up. Other wildlife apart from a few pigs, some wilderbeast and 2 lost mongeese were non existent.I wouldn’t go back to this place even if it was free and I had David Attenborough in the back of the Jeep giving a running commentary!!",2018/12/21,PeterC7694,
"They use leopards and bears as their main attraction in posters and advertisement. But the majority of place was covered with buffalos and wild boars. No sign of any leopards or bears. We spent more than 5 hours inside the safari and yet we found nothing.There were decent amount of deer and peacocks which were nice to see, but the expectations were much higher. There were a couple of elephants and we also saw a crocodile. All in all, a mundane experience, too pricy for what is being offered. The open field and the jungle has a nice vibe to it, and thus the two star, or else I would have given this one. Massive disappointment.",2018/12/21,Noor P,

"We walked to most of the sightseeing locations, and i would say 3/4 of the time someone would approach us and talk to us. We thought wow the people here are friendly here but in actual most of them are trying to sell you their service. We were walking and exploring the streets then someone came up to us and started talking asking where we are from, where we heading to and suddenly started called to the tuk tuk to bring us to the temples. Even though we didn't agree to anything. We walked off and he kept calling to us changing the price lower =.= (local price, good price, YEAH RIGHT!)Anyone that approach you, you can be friendly but be wary at the same time because chances are most of them are not really interested in where you came from or how you are doing.

We spent about 1 hour on top.... total of about 5hrs.You may want to bring a cap, sunglasses or an umbrella to shade away from sun as there’s no shelter on top.

While all the rooms you can visit are extremely interesting the amount of people coming to pray and make offerings to the tooth makes the whole experience quite rushed. You are not even allowed to stop for a second to have a look at the place where the tooth is kept. The line needs to keep moving at all times as the queue is enormous.

"The tooth is housed in a temple (obvs) which is part of a complex of buildings. We got there at 6pm during the ceremony. I would not do that again! There are soooo many people walking through and it’s dark so you miss out on the decorative temple. In addition, it is a functioning temple so people were there to worship. It was cringeworthy stepping over the legs of the devout. If I had more time I’d go in the morning but check there isn’t restricted times the tooth is on display.

"If you are into snorkelling and especially, if you are a nature/animal lover, you will be disappointed by people's behaviour in turtle point which i'll call ""circus point"". Some locals are giving algaes to tourist so they can take pictures and videos. So, they end up being 3 or 4 people disturbing 1 or 2 turtles which sometimes can't even swim. And the 'funny"" part is that the same local guys giving algaes, (for money of course and that is another story...) are asking them not to touch the turtles when feeding them. It's like what they do is not bad, the problem is just when you touch the animal.... If you just ignore this horror scene and go some meters further for snorkelling, you'll probably end up surrounded by boats with glass bottoms which are taking people who don't swim. So you can't enjoy it since you have to be careful and to look up and around instead of looking down.

We saw many animals and birds, and were impressed by the degree of nonchalance displayed by all of them, from Jungle Fowl, troops of varied small monkeys, birds, right up to a small herd of elephant complete with calf and a very pregnant mum-to-be. A heavy shower mid-afternoon drove many animals into tree cover, but the sun soon broke through, and even more seemed to emerge. For obvious reasons one has to remain in the vehicle except for a brief leg-stretcher at a beach, but all-too-soon it was approaching the strict 6.00.p.m. closing time, so we bade farewell to the Hornbills, the Fish Owls, Mongooses, Alligators, Buffalo, Deer, et al. (plus that final glimpse of leopard). Yala impressed as extremely well controlled and maintained, allowing freedom of movement of its inhabitants over a huge area. But, inevitably, the impact of thousands of visitors over a year must condition the natural behaviour of the inmates, but what alternative could there possibly be?",2018/12/16,BobPeersTraveller,

The National Museum is a fine example of curation. All information provided is well informed and available in English as well as local languages. We visited from 2.30 until 4.15 and will return for the national history museum. The building is cooled by fan and there is a small cafe where you can purchase cold water if you wish.,2018/12/16,F5240TUkatem,"Colombo, Sri Lanka"
We came in the late morning and although the traffic driving to the museum was really heavy the queue to enter was reasonable. We were on a coach tour and this was our first stop and there must of been half a dozen other coaches there too. The museum is spread out over a number of floors and in different wings. there are collections from times go by and so waxwork type displays of life as it was in different areas and eras. The building with its high ceilings and open planning is cool and an inviting relief from the outside heat of the day. There is plenty for people of all ages to see and of course there is a gift shop and cafe on the site as well as public toilets. There are many steps inside the building and therefore it could be difficult for people with mobility issues but they may have lift we did not see one but then we had no need to look. Well worth a visit.,2018/12/16,holiday-view23-7-11,"Basingstoke, United Kingdom"

"We really enjoyed our climb to the summit of Little Adam's Peak.Once leaving the Passara road there is a well surfaced path which gently climbs the hillside above the tea plantations.After a 10-15 minute gentle walk there was a sign to the right for mini Adam's Peak. After a short walk on a stone path there are well maintained concrete steps which lead you up most of the short, steep climb to the summit. This would take no more than 10 minutes with breather breaks.When the steps finish there is a short climb (10-15m) on rough paths, basically just pick one you like the look of and climb up it! And then you are at the summit, where we were rewarded with fabulous views as fortunately it was a clear day when we walked, failing the view there are a couple of nice Buddha statues!The route back down retraces your steps. You could, as we did, when you get back to the sign for mini Adam's Peak turn right to stop off at Cafe 98 (at 98 Acres resort) and extend the walk by heading over to 9 arches bridge and along the railway line back into Ella.",2018/12/14,RuthyTunes,Asia

There is a long walk by the moats and the water gardens begore you get to the steps. You dont need to be very fit to climb them as you can stop at several points to recover. The steps are not steep but can be a challenge for those with knee problems. However the 1200 steps up is worth it. Its a beautiful view, you can see the remnants of the palace walls. And the view from the top shows you the layout at ground level too. There is a huge Buddha statue directly opposite the palace some kms away, which you can appreciate only after you have climbed up.

"Yala National park advertises leopards. Our tour guide organised a jeep to take us around. The jeep picked us up at our hotel which was nice. Make sure you wear clothes with sufficient stretch to climb up. There are no steps and you need to be flexible enough to lift your foot to well above your knee and haul yourself up. If you cant make sure to get a jeep with a ladder but even thats a vertical ladder so those with knee issues please take note.The park is lovely, we were greeted at the entrance by black faced groups of monkey. Great photo op. Along the way there are lots of peacocks, painted storks, blue heron, the occasional pelican, kingfisher cormorant. Lots of large herds of deer, boar, water buffaloes. We even saw 5 crocodiles in different water bodies and a water monitor and an iguana. Leopards were hard to spot but finally we came across one far off. There were 20 jeeps all crowding jostling for a view. We caught sight of it getting off a tree and disappearing into the thicket at which point iur jeep driver reversed the jeep and brought us to another point when we clearly saw the leopard emerge from.the thicket and cross the road. That was it. No elephants. However after we left the park far behind and were returning at dusk around 6.15, we found a crowd of jeeps on the road. We too stopped and saw a calf running and heard from other jeeps that it was being chased by a leopard. We then saw another calf being pursued by the leopard. The calf came to the road and we saw it run across it at which point the leopard gave up and disappeared. That was the high point. The leopard sighting was lucky. Our trip was from 2.30-5.45pm.

There are a series of stone steps first, then metal ones before you reach the lion paws which are about two thirds of the way up. Some of the steps are rather exposed so if you have a fear of exposure you may find it difficult. It also gets very crowded and you have to pass people coming the other way on the same staircase.

Our driver parked and walked with us giving us a guided tour of the whole temple. It’s quite old with a lot of gold and a lot of history. This is the strangest place - a very grand temple, which is used by locals for worship, and well worth a visit on its own. Then there is the most crazy collection of things, just piled into cabinets or display cases with little or no explanation - reading glasses, watches, cameras, Encyclopedia Britannica.

"The rock fortress at Sigiriya is formidible. The site is very extensive, with moats and water-gardens preceeding your pathway to the rock fortress itself, which suddenly looms up 200 meters out of the plain. You enter via a gateway guarded by two massive paws - apparently belonging to a lion once carved on to the rock-face - and from that point on, the climb is ever upwards by rickety stairs winding round the rock-face and quite steep in places. Warning - The climb should not be attempted by those who have difficulties walking or stair-climbing unaided - there are about 1,800 -odd steps, and in the heat, with high humidity, it can be quite tiring and exhausting. And ignore the ""friendly"" locals who offer to help you climb up - they are of no use at all but will still demand $20 from you!. About half-way up is the ""mirror wall"" and the paintings of the Sigiriya ladies - these are worth all the effort - but NB: they can be closed to the public if hornets decide to build their nests there, as they do from time to time. The view from the top is magnificent, and stretches over the surrounding plain, so you can see why it was ideal as a fortress. There is even a swimming pool at the top! The site was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1982.",2018/12/11,JP1946,"London, United Kingdom"

If you consider doing Pidurangala only, I recommend both, if your budget makes it possible, sins these are totally different experiences, no substitute for each other.",2018/12/11,_kosf2014,"Pomaz, Hungary"
It is not cheap but very well looked after and just a wonder to look at location views and effort to build. Go early as gets busy and I would not want to be climbing all the way up the steps in a queue and queue all the way down....,2018/12/11,542andrewe,"Curry Rivel, United Kingdom"
So it is an early start but up for six and leaving dambulla means we are some of the first to get to Sigirya at 7.02. We crack on and get to the top well before 8. Several moans on the way from my partner about the pace. If you are not fit take your time worth the trip to the top but there is a first aid tent half way for a reason. We are the second couple at the top. It is quiet and mistical. The views are amazing even with the mist in the valleys all around. The you come down and explore the gardens you has seen from above.. all by 10. The gardens are so well looked after worth the money to get in.Worth the early start just to miss the crowds. As we leave there are cues all the way up...... next stop Pidurangala Rock to look back on the rock we just climbed... It was 10860 lkr but worth it.,2018/12/11,542andrewe,"Curry Rivel, United Kingdom"

"The temple of the tooth at Kandy is one of the most sacred site for Buddhists, as it is here that one of the Buddha's earthly molars is said to be preserved. The temple complex is set at one end of the city lake, and comprises a series of pavilions built around the original small temple and within the former royal palace. Outside are stalls selling lotus blossom flowers as offerings to the Buddha, and the scent of incense is everywhere in the air. You will be required to remove your shoes before entering (25 rupees) but you can wear socks, which is useful for foreigners, as the stone floors can sometimes be jagged underfoot. It is best to avoid prayer-times and festivals, as the place is jam-packed with pilgrims and devotees at the best of times.",2018/12/11,JP1946,"London, United Kingdom"

Once inside you shuffle along with the crowd to watch the ceremony, then shuffle upstairs to walk past the actual tooth! You can't actually see it, but you know it's there.

Though it is about 200 m high, well railing and nice iron steps will make the journey easy, last part little stiff but with caution you can reach there. The view from the top is excellent. There are little water pool, old stairs and different room compartment ruins. No shop is there on it's way so keep your water with you. In the midway, some part you are climb through a spiral iron stair for seeing the old cave paintings Entry fee for foreigners too high in everywhere in Srilanka.

"I didn't find this particularly taxing in terms of fitness, but there is a lot of picking your way over rocky and muddy paths, some quite steep. As advised we got there really early - make sure you allow about half an hour to queue for tickets, then drive the couple of miles more to the actual start of the trail (where there is a toilet and small cafe). You need to make sure you don't have any plastic bags, as they will be taken away at the gate, but plastic bottles are OK if the label is removed. It will be cold when you start (15 degrees when we left Nuwara Eliya at 5am, 12 degrees at the gate to Horton Plains at 6am), but once you start walking you will soon warm up, so only one extra layer is fine, and shorts would have been OK. We actually set off walking at 6.45. Shortly after the start you have a choice of which way round you go. We chose anticlockwise, but with hindsight, I think the clockwise route would have got us to World's End quicker. There is a map at the start, but few signs on the way. The terrain was tricky, with rocky paths to start, and a couple of streams to cross. It then got steeper, and much muddier, which slowed us up. Unless you've never seen a waterfall, don't waste time by diverting to Bakers Falls. It's good, but very much the supporting act, and you can always go back after you've been to World's End. We finally got to World's End at about 5 to 9, and were very fortunate indeed - literally within 5 minutes, the view had disappeared, the mist just rolling up the whole valley - quite a sight to see. So disappointing for anyone arriving after that, as there was nothing to see. The rest of the park is pleasant, but not spectacular. Further along the valley there is Mini World's End, but I can't tell you what the view would have been like! Once past these, the terrain becomes much flatter, apart from one fairly steep rocky path, and the mist doesn't encroach on the rest of the park. There's a toilet on the way back, on the edge of the hillside, open sided with a pretty decent view. I had walking shoes on, but on the way back we passed locals in flip flops!",2018/12/07,Alison M,"Ashtead, United Kingdom"
"As an obese person with a bad right knee and a recovering strained left upper thigh muscle, I was worried that I could not tak÷ on the challenge that was Horton's Plains, especially after reading horrifying reviews about it. Fortunately, all my fears were unfounded!Walking at a moderate pace, I found the walk entirely manageable though there were some tricky parts such as the rocky sections of the trail. On this note, do make sure to wear good shoes! We were also blessed as the weather conditions were in our favour. It did not rain the day before and neither did it on our hiking day. As a result, the paths were not very muddy and therefore easier to traverse. My friend and I, however, could see why the trail might be challenging should the weather be poor. A note on safety precautions to take, do not go too close to the edge of the cliff at World's End. According to our guide, a tourist had plunged to her death just a few weeks before our trip in an attempt to take a selfie.Some tips: 1. Check the weather forecast2. It is preferable to have a guide since some paths may not be clear to the inexperienced3. Bring some food and water4. Do not bring plastic bags as there are thorough bagchecks before one enters the park5. It is okay to bring bottled water into the park. However, do remove the plastic seal and label around the bottle before entering the park. 6. There are rubbish bins in the park. DO NOT LITTER. 7. Do not make too much noise as that might scare away wildlife. We had an unpleasant encounter with a group of noisy and rude tourists and had to ask them to tone it down. Do respect the environment and be comsiderate to others. That way, the walk will be pleasant for everyone! :)Overall, I enjoyed the trail as the views were lovely and it was certainly good exercise!",2018/12/07,msamaezing,"Singapore, Singapore"

People in their hundreds arrive with bouquets of waterlily flowers as gifts to place on tables near the location of the sacred tooth. At intervals great dustbin-sized heaps of flowers and petals are gathered off the tables thrown away to make room for the ever-increasing offerings. Very slowly the crowd moves and eventually your part of the throng moves past the tooth location and you get back to some space. Phew. If you are local, you have ensured good luck from the gods.

"I climbed the rock 15 years ago, in the pouring rain and low cloud, so saw very little from the top, which was the only reason why I wanted to do it again. There is now a good museum, and of course the nice gardens, but you find yourself itching to start the climb. It's not really too hard if you take it at your own pace, The stone steps at the start are tricky as there is no handrail, but further up it is easier as it's mostly ladders and steps with rails. If you struggle (as my friend did) there are ""guides"" who will help you to climb. Hers was very pleasant and patient, and gave us a lot of information as we went up. However, BEWARE. When we got back down, he expected a LOT of money, and it quite took the edge off the day when he was scathing about his tip (2000 rupees, approx. £10).Watch out too for the monkeys, who will grab at any food/sweets you happen to have in an open rucksack pocket etc.No need for stout shoes - good sports sandals (e.g. Teva) are perfectly fine.The view from the top was actually quite disappointing - forest in all directions.",2018/12/06,Alison M,"Ashtead, United Kingdom"

"With high hopes for our tour of Yala with the promise from the driver of seeing leopards as well as all the expected animals, it started well sighting an elephant and crocodile within the first few hundred metres. Next came herds of deer, buffalo, wild boar, a pair of mongeese, troupes of monkeys including blackfaced, peacocks and hens, an eagle and a large owl.Then the heavens opened up and the sideways pelting rain made it a trifle uncomfortable although fortunately, we had a 6 seat jeep to ourselves so could move from side to side to minimise the soaking. Even though roads quickly were inundated the driver was skilled and we did not get stuck as some did. Like us, the black bear's elephants, crocodiles, wild boar and buffalo were not phased and carried on as usual making for good photos. The primary purpose for our trip to Yala was to see leopards and we were promised/assured by our driver that no matter what we would see at least a couple as this is the largest concentration in the world. Sadly no one told the leopards that rain was not a problem, apparently, they did not want their spots to wash off in the torrential rain. We enjoyed what we saw even the moderate soaking but highly recommend two things... 1) hire a luxury (not really luxury but better) definitely not a standard jeep/driver/guide unless you are travelling as a large group and 2) do not book a tour if there is the slightest chance of rain let alone a downpour as it will be an uncomfortable waste of money. All drivers will know this so beware.",2018/12/06,petercrawley,"Melbourne, Australia"
We were fortunate enough to a close encounter with a leopard which made our safari a memorable event!The local young driver was good allowing us enough time for pictures and for spotting lots of animals.I believe without the leopard the safari might not have been this great so we feel really lucky!,2018/12/06,MicGheTagJo,paris

Although I had been before many years ago, I was past the Tooth Relic before I realised it, so only got a glimpse.

"Mount Lavinia Beach is a small patch of beach close to Colombo, just south of the city. It is an average beach as such because I found that the shacks didn't really maintain the acceptable level of hygiene and the beach was broadly speaking quite littered. Now I won't be the first one to say that it was filthy, but it is a bit over crowded and that is only adding to the problem. Mt Lavinia beach has great scope for becoming a welcome short drive from Colombo, but thanks to the increasing traffic and over crowding it is being slowly becoming like most of the beaches in the sub continent.",2018/12/05,nrm77,"London, United Kingdom"
"The fort attached Galle is unlike most others you may have seen. No huge rampart, cannons, peepholes in the mighty walls and invincible heavy doors. It's just more of a tall, granite boundary wall that runs from right next to the famous Galle cricket stadium all the way along the sea face, to the lighthouse and then back on the other side. Inside this area are the Dutch hospital, museum, Church, police station and the very best (all ranges) of eateries and shopping. If you were to walk all through it (minus the shopping and eating, worth just picture breaks), or can be done in under two hours at a leisurely pace. But certainly a must visit when in Galle as this could well be termed the epicenter of everything here. A lot of history convinced with narrow, picturesque streets, lovely people and tons to see, do and savour- that's Galle Fort for you! PS: 1. The fort walls and the higher ground are what saved this part of town from the fierce 2004 Tsunami, while most coastal and lower lying areas were swept away or destroyed.2. Do not recommend staying in this area at the criminally high rates (for the good places) unless you hate travel of even a few km).",2018/12/05,shyamnambiar,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates"

You then have to go to the foreigners shoe counter (= pay again, at R100) At 0900 the place was jampacked with devotees and their offerings and a long queue snaked up the stairs to the place where the golden casket of the tooth is held.

The items range not only from religious items, relics to idols of deities, but also Automobiles, old discarded consumer items, antiques and many other things. Some items on display are quiet interesting.Overall, the temple appears more like a Museum. There is a nominal fee charged for entering the temple.

The site contains the ruins of an upper palace located on the flat top of the rock, a mid-level terrace that includes the Lion Gate and the mirror wall with its amazing frescoes of the ""Sigiriya Ladies"" (apparently there were 500 such ladies when the place was completed) and the lower palaces located behind the lower gardens, moats and ramparts which protected the citadel. The site was both a palace and a fortress and it will amaze you.

"I feel bad for saying this, but we didn’t enjoy this temple compared to others in the area. Firstly, it was a hassle to get in. They don’t let you borrow a sarong like other temples and there aren’t obvious vendors nearby who do either. So you need to buy one, or wear pants, which isn’t fun when it’s really hot out and why buy something you won’t use again. One of the security check ladies turned my wife away, saying her long and airy dress was “transparent” which it wasn’t. So after I found a sarong, we had to go back and find one for her, spending more money. Then the price. It cost us Rs3000 for tickets. Much higher than other temples we visited so far. Inside, there wasn’t anything interesting for non-devout Buddhist’s. The inner chamber where the tooth supposedly resides was closed and there was nothing to see except a blanket with his likeness hanging in front of the door. Upstairs, there were some areas of worship but visually and historically it wasn’t very intriguing at all, and almost looked like some parts had been pillaged of artifacts. Overall, it did not feel ancient because it isn’t. It did not feel peaceful, because it isn’t when so many people are scrambling around. Visually, it seemed like things were missing and I constantly thought “is this it??” Or “am I missing some area??”.If you had to choose, I’d recommend Bahirawakanda Vihara or Ranawana Purana Rajamaha Viharaya.

And yet the tooth is stored on the wooden constructed first floor lol. He saw my logic. We enjoyed our tour and were impressed by the site.BE AWARE - as the gate police are on a kick back from the sari hire blokes outside, they are VERY STRICT about turning you away, unlike other temples.

Shoes have to be left at the entrance and there are steps leading up to the sanctuary where the relic is kept. Along the way there are beautiful paintings and statues and typical Kandyan decorations on the pillars of red, black and yellow horizontal stripes. It is usually very crowded and most people take offerings of flowers which may be purchased outside for around$1.00 US for a small basket. The stone steps leading up are very steep to climb. The exit is through a different door and there are provisions here to light lamps with oil and wicks.

"I love visiting museums. I think this one needs a little bit more work to bring it up to standard and in a city that is rapidly updating a lot it’s surprising that they haven’t a more modern museum. There’s way too much repetitive artifacts and not enough explanation. There’s also very little seating and after an hour, you need to be able to rest your feet. It feels like the exhibits need to be updated, and the flow more useful for travelers to understand the story of Sri Lanka. It’s has no air conditioning either, so avoid on hot days.

However, although we didn't see many birds, we did see quite a few - kites, bee-eaters, kingfishers, egrets, pelicans, lessor cormorants, and quite a few other that I can't remember the names of, in addition to monitor lizards and a baby croc!So, I would have given a higher mark if we had gone later/far earlier, which is not really fair on the park - I'm sure it would be better then and get a higher mark.

I felt this Temple was a complete rip off. Westerners were charged to enter when Sri Lankans were not. Every body involved was just out to make a buck from the tourist. On walking round the Temple tourists were all channeled into a narrow area and barked at by the staff working there.

"A gem of a museum, going by the priceless exhibits in it. If anyone wants to know about the amazingly close civlisational, cultural, artistic and spiritual bonds between Sri Lanka and India during the various eras of history, there is no better place to discover it than in this museum. It will surprise and disappoint those who believe Hinduism and Buddhism are dissimilar or mutually antagonistic. The museum has relatively less focus on Sri Lanka's Islamic heritage.I had gone to see the trilingual (Chinese, Tamil, Persian) stone inscription about the voyage of the great Chinese explorer Zheng He (1371-1433), who visited both Sri Lanka and India. The inscription shows that he offered prayers to Allah, Buddha and Shiva (a Hindu deity) for his own safety and for peace in the world. A good historical example of Sri Lanka-India-China affinity.My two big complaints about the museum: 1) The Museum Shop is hopelessly small and short of material on sale; and 2) The museum guides should be proficient in English and know more about the history of the museum and its exhibits.If you are a visitor to Colombo, don't miss it.",2018/11/24,Sudheendra K,Mumbai (India)

Most of the restaurants were in the hotels that line the beach and many had 'residents only' signs which didn't encourage us to visit.Beautiful but such a shame there's not much there. We wondered if we were just too early in the season but were told that this is pretty much all there is.",2018/11/22,Koshkha,"Northampton, United Kingdom"

We visited here whilst in Kandy. I am not at all religious but felt quite moved and it felt moving to be in the grounds and observe the locals in their beliefs and religion. We had a blessing in one temple.It does get very busy when the Monks open the tooth relic so be prepared to queue and it is very hot in the temple.You have to dress appropriately to enter.This is very sacred to the locals so you need to respect them at all times but well worth a visit,2018/11/22,Sophiedavies21,

It's worthy of being on any bucket list. However, nature is unpredictable, so there's no guarantee that the fauna, sunshine, or panoramic views you were hoping to see will appear before you - sadly, on the day that we went, the only birds we saw were the spotted dove and jungle fowl; and the view from World's End was obliterated by clouds (even though we were early).

"A beautiful heritage site ruined by pushy,annoying “guides” from the moment you step off the bus. This should be stopped as it just puts you off. The walk itself is not for the feint hearted. Its a fair wander through from the carpark to the start of the climb which could be so much more bearable without pests trying to grab your arm to “help”.The climb is long and arduous and the steps slippery marble, uneven, no handrails . I only made it a third of the way up to first base stopping point. In 90% humidity and carrying too many extra pounds and arthritic joints it was time to admit defeat. My partner made the top though!

"We visited Yala in the hopes of seeing the leopards for which the park is so famous. Unfortunately, that was the same reason that 100s of others were there at the same time, charging around the park in diesel belching off-road vehicles, reacting so much noise and pollution that the only leopard that we did see, was available for viewing for one second as she raced across a track having been surrounded by a hundred or so vehicles.There was only one elephant that provided a distant viewing and a single large crocodile also seen from some distance. Other animals that were a little more numerous were the wild pigs, deer, mongoose, and water buffalo and there were numerous species of birds to be seen.Yala has much potential but in the drive to attract tourists, they have driven away the wildlife so it is unfortunately hard to recommend. If you want to see elephants, there are other parks in the southern part of Sri Lanka that will provide far more animals to view. For Yala to succeed in it’s mission, they need to limit significantly the numbers of visitors entering the park and make it a true safari adventure - that way they will be doing the precious wildlife there a much better service.",2018/11/20,timsQ8422OW,"Hong Kong, China"

"My first advice is to get a qualified guide who speak your language if you want to get the full benefit of your visit. Please negotiate the price before hiring him. Without a guide you might find it difficult to get about as there are a lot of touts around who will ask money for every turn.Second is your dress code. They do require knees and shoulders to be covered for both sexes, so keep that in mind. Footwear not allowed inside temple premises as mark of respect but a rack outside is there at the entrance, for a small fee to be taken care of your footwear.Third is your entry fee. I do agree with you the fees are too high. However it is out of our control & the Government should do something about it in fairness to tourists.My fourth advice is to arrange with your guide during non-busy hours to visit. It is open 365 days from 0530 am to 8 pm. But 0930 am & 0630 pm are Thevava (Puja) times. During these times you may have more chances of seeing the tooth relic. A brief description: Sri Dalada Maligawa or The Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic is a Buddhist temple in the city of Kandy, Sri Lanka. It is located in the royal palace complex which houses the Relic of the tooth of Buddha. Since ancient times, the relic has played an important role in local politics because it is believed that whoever holds the relic holds the governance of the country. Kandy was the last capital of the Sinhalese kings and is a UNESCO world heritage site partly due to the temple. The temple which houses the Sacred Tooth Relic of the Buddha is one of the holiest shrines in the entire Buddhist world.Good luck on your visit and may Lord Buddha bless you even if you’re a non-Buddhist. If you benefitted following my advice please ask your friends to read my advice before visiting this temple in order to avoid facing difficulties.",2018/11/20,Rohan R,"Colombo, Sri Lanka"

I spent two and a half hours walking around Udawattekele this morning and very pleasant it was too. As others have said it’s hard to believe that your in the centre of Kandy. In some places there is no traffic noise at all. Deer and wild boar seem abundant and surprisingly unruffled by human presence. Bird spotting is challenging given the high canopy but patience is rewarded - I saw hornbills and flycatchers amongst other birds.I cannot believe that some reviewers are complaining about an entrance fee of about £3 or €3. Get real! This is chicken feed and it all goes to help maintain the sanctuary.I did get leeched - on my foot and only discovered when I returned to my hotel and a very bloated leech fell on the floor as I took my trainers off. If you’ve never had a leech attach itself to you it’s both painless and harmless. Once they’ve had their fill (and it’s not very much of your blood) they simply detach themselves.

We had a personal guide organised by our driver but somehow a ""helper"" latched on to us and we couldn't get rid of this extra person who insisted on helping us walk up stairs even when repeatedly saying no he just kept following us. At the end the guide demanded 35 dollars for this helper and it was clear that it was a racket and even though our driver had said the guide would be 2500 rupees for the 1.5 hour guide he demanded 5000. This all ended in a difficult argument between us, the driver and the guide. Very disappointed at this behaviour and can't recommend this attraction because of this as it ruined our experience.

"We went to the Temple having been recommended by a number of people that it is the main thing to see in Kandy. Whilst it is undoubtedly beautiful, there are several points that i was a little annoyed about. 1 - there is a separate sign for foreigners to buy tickets and if you are from UK/ Europe/ US etc you pay 1500 SLR - less if from Asia/ Sri Lanka2 - My partner wore long shorts that covered his knees but was told he would have to wear longer even though he had specifically asked at the gates that morning if they were ok. He then had to rent a sarong. 3 - From arriving at the gate we were constantly pressurised in to having a guide. We managed to dodge about 4 but eventually couldn’t shake the 5th one off us. 4 - When we finished, our guide told us that he would accept a donation for his trouble and suggested 3000SLR (about £15). We gave him 2000 and he looked at it and said ‘Well as long as you’re happy with yourself!’ This is all after being told that Buddhism is a philosophy not a religion and has no rules. It seems a shame that my over riding memory is not of the beautiful place but the constant necessity to keep paying out and I’m not sure that that is what a Buddhist temple is supposed to be about?",2018/11/17,SeldonJane,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom"

"It is worth visiting the temple of sacred tooth of Buddha several times.However,the sacred tooth itself is open to visitors every ten years. Therefore,I would advise all who are interested to see the sacred tooth,to enquire which year and month it will be again open for visitors.",2018/11/16,drsbthakur,"Kolkata, India"
we had gone there early morning around 7 and we got a chance to see the prayer ceremony and change of the doorkeeper for the Temple where the tooth is kept. there is a museum just next to the temple where we can saw all Buddhas' gifted from different countries to Sri Lanka.,2018/11/16,Monishaak,"Nairobi, Kenya"

"It's not the prettiest beach. There's some pretty good snorkelling at the northern end - we just wish we had taken flippers because the current was pushing us around. Lion fish, cuttlefish, reef sharks and turtles were the highlights. On the southern end there's a spot where all the tourists gather to feed one or two local turtles. It's a bit pushy shovy as people clamour for the best instagram shots. Would be a bit nicer if people wouldn't grab the turtles either. Other than that, usual beach things to do - bars, restaurants, surf, jetski, boat tours etc. Nice sunset too though.",2018/11/15,roamingkiwi24,

"I really want to be positive and re-instate what others are saying about this place - yes it is fascinating with interesting history and stunning views from both the bottom and the top, but I have to give honest feedback here:1) Why the obsession with quoting prices in US dollars? Why not just give the price in rupees - we're in Sri Lanka, not USA. Given that the majority of visitors are from anywhere but the US, I find this irritating.2) Given the amount of money being raised from the hefty entrance fee (US $30), one would think they'd spend some of it on the main visitors centre building. It looks like something out of a communist era - all dreary concrete, no clear signage on where to go after the ticket office - just not very inviting at all;3) The cafe - oh dear! The only 'food' available was some sugary round donut thing, or fresh juice. Again, a dreary dirty building so uninviting I hastened to get out of there. 4) Secret 'guides' roaming the park that attach themselves to you like leeches and before you know it you're stuck with them, at a hefty price. I had no intention of climbing the rock for health reasons - was more than happy to enjoy the experience from the ground - but these two guides started by offering me an arm on a small flight of steps, then just stuck to me like glue insisting I climb at least to the lion's feet. They could clearly see I was struggling with the ascent. Offered a smidgeon of history here and there, then stung me for 5000 rupees EACH (almost the equivalent of the entry price - each!) at the end of it. Asked me if I was happy with their service? No I bloody wasn't!So my advice is be very wary of anyone approaching you if you are doing it alone, and be prepared for what I consider a pricey experience. The grounds I have to say are beautiful and meticulously maintained.",2018/11/15,judi_rose,"Hobart, Australia"
"This place is something else. The first section of the walk goes straight to the ticket office, where foreigners are charged in USD (but you can pay in rupee) and quite rightly pay a whole lot more than locals. There is then a delightful walk towards the rock, we looked straight down at an alligator swimming in the pond, great sighting. The walk turns into a climb up steep steps. You are surrounded by ancient brickwork covered in moss. The giant boulders are covered in ancient step chipped away. It is truly fascinating. Next comes a spiral staircase to take you high onto a ledge with some stunning frescos. Next is the mirror wall, where the ancients have defaced with graffiti, strange how yesterdays vandalism becomes todays priceless history. Banksy?? Onwards and upwards. There is a Red Cross station and rest area before the final staircase to the summit. Beware of the monkeys, do NOT leave any bags unattended. They figure zippers. One stole my suncream and climbed a tree. Fortunately a well aimed pebble dislodged the booty and my sun lotion was returned. We then ascended to the spectacular summit. Take suncream and take water, there are no refreshments available en route. And do visit the museum first. Alas at the end you have to exit via the giftshop, a collection of vendors the hassle you endlessly. Do not visit Sri Lanka without coming here.",2018/11/15,Andrew D,"Jamieson, Victoria, Australia"
"Very sad to see this beautiful beach which was once a clean and a nice place to go for a morning run or a stroll, is now dirty. We saw plastic bags of curry, plastic bottles and garbage thrown on the beach. Why isn't anyone responsible to maintain the beach? This is the only beach in Colombo that people can enjoy. Why is keeping the beach clean such a hard thing to do? It is also very crowded in the evenings. The only time it's a bit quiet is in the afternoon. Good for a sea bath.

"We visited during the ceremony at the Buddhist new year so the place was heaving and it was raining. You will need to remove your shoes at a hut outside the main entrance. Our guide gave a full explanation of the proceedings and showed us the best vantage points to see the key elements of the ceremony. The 'tooth room' is almost completely gold - amazing. Other parts of the building are also interesting, particularly the paintings that show the story of the 'Tooth' ending up in Kandy.

In order to encourage more Indian visitors, recommend reduction in the entry fee!Srilankans , like Indians, are very religious and visit temples like this with a lot of seriousness and sincerity. It is a very big complex and one will need at least an hour's time to have a good look.Visit to Srilanka is not considered complete without a visit to this temple.Don't miss all the paintings showing where all the Tooth travelled before reaching Kandy.",2018/11/15,Relgemini,"Chennai, India"

The day we visited, it was overcrowded & we could barely see anything or worship as were getting pushed out by the crowd. We did not feel contented from within. One thing that put me off was the person manning the shoe rack who asked us to give a 'compulsory' donation. When we gave, it wasn't put in the donation box but kept on the shelf - which means it would go in their pockets!",2018/11/15,Kaiz_sm,"Mumbai, India"

The bay just behind the famed Mount Lavinia Hotel (with its Colonial-Era Ambiance and Stories) is just fabulous early morning providing an ample sea-bathing experience. At nights, this beach comes alive with the Colombo night-lights that can be seen from here, beach night-life and sea-fronted restaurants well worth trying out.

"Go early! This is not a trip to undertake in the heat of the afternoon . Wear sensible shoes and take water . This is a fascinating historical site that rises out of the flattish surrounding countryside. It is easy to see why the King who had his palace built at the top had the rock painted white to give the illusion of his palace floating on a cloud. The rock is approached first through what was a water garden and then a boulder garden. These were also once part of the defensive system. The steps that started in the boulder garden bothered our group of 4 slightly because they seemed narrow and some were sloping and had a gravelly surface. Do not worry - you do not come back down this way! The first actual staircase you encounter is a spiral one that takes you up to a sort of cave under a overhang. Here you find some spectacular wall paintings that are from the original palace. When the Buddhist monks took over the citadel after the King left most of the painting were cleaned away but these were too difficult to reach. A second spiral staircase takes you back down so there is no need to worry about passing on these stairs. You can also give these paintings a total miss if you don’t fancy the spiral staircase! Continuing upwards via pathways you then arrive at a large flat area before the stairs that take you up the actual rock itself. Here there are plenty of places to rest in the shade and you can buy a drink. There is also a first aid post. Watch the monkeys in this area. We saw them take someone’s water bottle! There are also lots of signs warning you to be as quiet as possible so as not to annoy wasps and bees that nest on the trees and rock. Our guide told us they are more of a problem in the afternoon as the heat rises - another reason to set off early! We were not troubled by them at all. The final stage of the climb is the most challenging. There are several sets of metal stairs. This is the way up and down so is mostly single file due to the number of people. When we were coming down the up side were actually queuing - yet another reason to arrive early! The top itself is largely flat and there are incredible views all around. We are not in the first flush of youth but we took it steady, paced ourselves, and the effort was well worth it. As previously mentioned once you get back down to the flat area the rest of the route back down is much easier and quicker than the way up.",2018/11/12,carha,"Bristol, United Kingdom"

"Quite expensive tickets (compared to other activities at Sri Lanka), but a very nice trip - all the way from the bottom and the old water gardens to the top of the rock. The mirror wall and the old wall paintings were nice, but for us the view and the reuins of the ancient palace at the top were the best. Lots of monkeys, but they were not aggressive. If you are afraid of heights, you are in for a real challenge, but it is worth it.At times the place may be closed due to poison wasps, but this was not a problem now.",2018/11/11,tripaleks,"Oslo, Norway"
I spent sleepless night prior to climbing as wasn’t sure if I could do as I am scared of heights and not fit. Got there and was pouring rain with waterfalls on all the stairs going up. We had guide to take us up and he was wonderful and encouraged me all the way to the top! You can stop at Lion’s foot as last part steepest but I am so glad I kept going. Was not that scary and just take a couple of stops on way up. If hot weather go early. I would definitely do it again.,2018/11/11,279benitar,Burradoo
"We really enjoyed the morning hiking to the Worlds End in the National Park. It is quite a rugged hike but not difficult as long as you wear good hiking or (joggers) walking shoes. The canyon, waterfall and scenery is beautiful and sometimes breathtaking. Walking through the jungle you can hear so many sounds of nature with lots of birds. We also saw monkeys and deer. Take plenty of water, some sunscreen even a little snack and wear a hat. Be sure to do this early in the morning before it gets too hot and the crowds too big. We thought the entry fee into the park was expensive (about $75AUD per person) but we still enjoyed it and were happy we did it.",2018/11/11,Louise G,"Townsville, Australia"

"This is a lovely beach that is totally spoilt by the awful way people treat the turtles. They are wild animals not there to be mounted and ridden, coerced onto the beach, or stalked through the water for hours (yes some individuals wouldn’t leave them alone for hours). It would be great if the initiative could be taken in the spots where they do appear frequently for signs to remind people of this. And for beach goers to educate themselves on how to treat wildlife appropriately. Enjoy the turtles from a respectful distance whether snorkelling or paddling.. More about the beach:As is often in Sri Lanka the waves are rough, something to bear in mind if you have little ones. But they are fine if you’re a fairly good swimmer. You can find some good spots for sunbathing at points along the beach. There are the occasional littered areas in between. We walked home as the sun was going down to a nice sunset and impressive lightning on the horizon. As the beach isn’t one long strip it makes an interesting walk round all the bends. We enjoyed ourselves.",2018/11/10,Dani P,
"I would suggest to do a quick read up about the history of the place just like any other tourist attraction with historical significance. It's amazing how more than thousands of years ago humans would have build these structures at such a height without any modern lifting equipment. Try to avoid the scorching afternoon sun and carry water, small towel and wear light comfortable clothes. I bought some mystery boxes made by local artisans, which were being sold by many vendors on and around the lion rock, negotiate for a good bargain. There's no plumbing on the rock so use the washroom on the ground before climbing up.",2018/11/10,racybhavik,"Hong Kong, China"

"If you have read a few reviews you are probably wondering two things : - what will i see?- what about the leeches? About those leeches - i went early November, it had been raining hard recently and rained on our walk back. My guide wore flip flops and bare feet and wasnt worried by the leeches. He found one to show me but they didnt seem to be an issue. Dont let thinking about them put you off. Same with mosquitoes- according to my guide humans are not the preferred food so the mozzies dont bother you in so balanced an ecosysytem. What can you expect to see ? You see scorpions, a couple of snakes if your guide has keen eyes like mine, many lizards (including the kangaroo lizard) , many butterflies, a giant squirrel, some macaques and some giant millipedes. Birds are best seen early in the morning so not great for daytrippers. Dont expect to see the leopards or elephants. They are here but you wont see them.I saw a great variety in prices for this tour . I paid 95$ for a solo trip, pick up and drop off in Galle, including all tolls, entry fee and guide charges. The only extra cost was lunch and a hefty tip for the guide who was an absolute legend.

Once inside the complex, the shoe storage area is off to the left -- a word to the wise, the IN and OUT is the same place, and you might get stuck behind a tour group!Inside, the temple itself is an amalgamation of ancient temple (built in the center, with old wood, stone, gold, paintings, etc.) and a more modern surrounding building. The area for veneration of the tooth of Buddha has mats and numerous devotees praying while sitting on the floor. You can only see the door to the reliquary, you can't see the golden reliquary itself (picture only), and it is understandably very crowded in this spot. A new worship area has been built behind and adjacent to the ancient one, and has pictorial representations of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, so is worth a visit.Off to the left hand side is a small museum with a taxidermied tusker and his regalia, an area for making candle offerings, and parts of the old palace. Off of the main hall there is a small octagonal library which is also an interesting visit.",2018/11/06,redmed2000,"Silver Spring, Maryland"

"Definitely worth visiting if you are in Kandy. Our driver took us in so he also acted as our guide. Make sure you wear a long dress or long pants and cover your shoulders. We didn't expect they would mind what my 12 year old daughter was wearing but she wasn't allowed in with her shorts and t shirt. We had read that we could loan a sari if necessary, but that wasn't an option at the gate we entered and we had to pay for one from a local vendor and were expected to return it afterwards. We paid our entry at the vending machines but they didn't give change so make sure you have the correct money. Like everywhere in Sri Lanka, locals seemed to be able to enter for free and they charged 1500LKR per person for foreigners. However it was still worthwhile and we were very interested by the history of the scared tooth.",2018/11/06,Elizabeth A,"Pagewood, Australia"

"Yala NP, is truly a paradise of leopards- the most elusive of the big cats. The climate is pretty hot but cooler in the rainy season. It has the highest density of leopards on the planet and though not guaranteed chances are high that you'll find one. Safari begins at 6am and you can choose between full day (6am-6pm) or half day (6am-12pm). All safaris are done in jeeps which can be arranged through the hotel. The roads in the park are quite bumpy and pretty hard to travel when they get muddy after rains. Apart from leopards, wildlife such as elephants, deer, sambur, jackal, sloth bear etc and many species of birds can be seen. Best time to travel would be in between June to August as the animals are concentrated around watering holes but animlas could be spotted year-around.As for accomodation hotels can be found in Tissamaharama, the nearest town or bungalows or campsites can be booked in the park itself. Recommended campsites- WARAHANA/KOSGASMANKADABungalows- WARAHANA/THALGASMANKADA/MAHASEELAWA These places are maintained by the DWC. You should take food and provisions along with you and for bungalows there is a care taker. As for campsites a tracker is given and the jeep driver will stay along with you.A safari Jeep service I'd recommend is KAMESH- +94 71 218 1506",2018/11/05,bimsaralwis,"Kandy, Sri Lanka"

A varied collection of shrines, stupas and museums with eclectic gifts/ donations from around the world.

"An absolutely amazing site, well worth the climb - which is not as strenuous as is might look. Do go early though- try to arrive just before the site opens (at 7am, in high season I think earlier) in order to be one of the first to go up and because it can get too hot later on in the day. It is almost impossible to overtake people going up in front of you so once it gets busy, you can get stuck for quite a while - we have heard that in summer, it took people up to three hours to get up to the top. Take time to enjoy the water and boulder garden before going up as the way down will take you on a different route, to I think the west gate.",2018/11/04,christineg596,"Karlsruhe, Germany"

The ancient citadel of Sigiriya or Lion's Rock as it's referred too was spectacular- no pictures can do it justice.Be prepared to WALK LOTS and CLIMB HIGHTS - so if your unfit or scared of heights then this will be a challenge but worth it.Wear good walking shoes and plenty of water - it's hot and humid and you need to cover up.All that aside you will be rewarded with a great adventure and spectacular views of this ancient citadel - a MUST DO if in Sri Lanka,2018/11/04,riccozen,"North Mackay, Australia"
"This visit was a highlight of our trip to Sri Lanka - a must do. The climb was challenging and I am not great with heights but I was determined to make it to the top with my family. It is an amazing experience, a bit scary in places on the upper levels on the metal steps. My husband and I are in our 50s and managed fine but didn't look down during some of the more challenging elements of the steep climb. Our teenage daughters scampered up and had no problems or fear at all. I am surprised by reviews that don't recommend going to the top and moan about the prices. This is a world heritage site that is historic, ancient and quite simply unique - why would you not pay the small fee to go to the top once there? To go to the top of the Eiffel Tower is approx $75. These sites need to be maintained and tourists do need to give a little back. Yes tipping is de regueur but a little goes a long way. Going out in Sri Lanka make sure you have lots of cash in small notes. While lots of places take cards, most still prefer cash. I didn't know the actual price of the entry ticket as we organised a guided tour from our hotel so we were fortunate to have both a driver and a guide and it was well worth the extra paid as it made for a seamless visit. We learned about the history of the rock and the surrounding gardens from our guide and our guide stayed with us all the way up. It was obvious that the guide (and other guides we encountered) are very proud of their country and rightly so. It is an exhilarating feeling to make it to the top of the rock after a challenging and slightly scary climb but definitely worth it as the views are stunning. There are a lot of wild monkeys around the site and on the upper platform and they love to swing around the steps of the upper levels which made the experience all the more uniquely challenging but overall a brilliant interactive experience. We loved it. We wend mid-morning on a weekday and it really wasn't that busy. If you go to Sri Lanka, don't miss out on this.",2018/11/04,Annabelle68,"Banstead, United Kingdom"

Every so often the clouds broke and we caught a glimpse of the valley - not having seen how high up we were, it came as a bit of a shock!

Drink lots of water and take it steady. Enjoy!",2018/11/03,Scottishlady1962,"Stirling, United Kingdom"
The rock itself is impressive from a distance but that's all. The climb to view the paintings is hard work and hot. Wear sturdy shoes as the steps/ground are very uneven and you need to watch your step all the way. Don't attempt the climb if you have even the slightest fear of heights - there is an iron staircase and walkway exposed on one side which no doubt is safe but in a crowd is very unnerving. I was concentrating so much on my footing during the climb that nearly missed the paintings! Really not worth the effort/strain in the heat as you are not allowed to take photos and they are all printed in the guide books. Didn't bother continuing to the top so a waste of money for me.,2018/11/03,AnnandBill,"London, United Kingdom"
"The frescos are nice - you do get herded through a bit. The views up the top are nice too and you have more room there.

"Did this as a part of a group tour Sept. Guide insisted we go later in the afternoon to avoid the crowd and (supposedly) the heat. It was very hot, so not sure if this was wise. Perhaps since we're regular gym goers we're a little fitter than others our age (60's), husband plays regular tennis, I'd did lots of work on the step climber at the gym prior to going but we both found the humidity was a killer. Made it to the top (unaided), however suffered a heat rash that lasted over a week, wouldn't have done it at all had I realised there are large wasp nests up there (I'm allergic to bee stings, think wasps will effect me as well). My husband's not great with heights, I had to convince him that going back down when we got to the spiral staircases that hang off the side of the cliff was not an option. It's not easy to change your mind when you get to that point. There's a first aid station (large, purpose built about 2/3rds the way up), fair guess they've had big problems sometimes? Falls are easy, keep your eyes down there are many trip hazards, the steps are very uneven (like The Great wall), some are narrow, others wide, some easy and secure others loose. The view at the top is amazing (as the other reviews have already portrayed), reconsider if you're very overweight,suffer from heart issues, heavy smoker, pregnant or have a major health condition. It's not worth dying for a view. Some people were pushed up to the top by locals (people who make a living out of aiding the unfit to get to the top) but is it worth it? Personally, I'd rather take pics from below than get to the top at the risk of my health. Please see photos attached that you could expect to see from the top and make up your mind. At least take water, a hat, good shoes for climbing (even a walking stick),use sunscreen, mosquito repellent etc. plenty of people to sell you things at the bottom",2018/11/02,BIGDAYOUT_11,"Sydney, Australia"
"This is defiantly a must see and do in Sri Lanka. The views from the top are incredible so don’t give up and make sure you make it to the top.There are approximately 1,300 steps and it takes around 45-50mins to climb due to the large crowds and you can only climb some sections one by one. To avoid having to wait behind larger (possibly slower) groups try and go as early as possible. Make sure you take enough water as there is no place to buy more once you have passed the initial ticket check point. There is also no shade at the top so many people had umbrellas to protect them from the sun. Might be handy as a walking stick too should you need the extra help to make it up the steps. There are also helpers available (at a price) to give you the extra help up the stairs should you need it. No one in our group used them but we saw a couple dotted around asking if anyone needed assistance. This is suitable for people of all ages. Just take your time and enjoy the views along the way, it’s no race.Tickets are 50 rupees for locals and 5000 rupees for everyone else. Despite these steep prices, it is worth it!",2018/11/02,priyaa565,
"A very strenuous climb but well worth it. Once you get to the top it is incredible the view is beautiful and the pool just blew me away. Our driver explained the story of the rock and said there was a pool at the top I as blown away at the size and just the fact that it was built on the top of this huge rock. We climbed on a Sunday so it was really crowded, it took ages to get up as there were so many elderly people which were incredible to even attempt the climb and lots of mums carrying their children.

The hike up to Mini Adam's Peak is approximately 30 mins from the Chillout Lodge. There are about 350 steps to climb towards the last part of the hike leading to the peak.

We’ve visited many incredible temples in Asia and when we saw the cost of entering this one we weren’t too sure as it’s considerably higher than most places. My advice would be to go about 5pm. Walk around the outside whilst it’s still light. Look around the museum then back into the main part for 6ish as the ceremony is about to start. This part is very cultural and is worth witnessing. What we didn’t like were the ‘shoe storage’ we ‘donated’ 100 for them to look after our shoes but then they asked for more donations at the end and it was very obvious that some of the money was not going into the donation box.,2018/11/02,KiwG,

(You have to leave your shoes in locker room... and you have to pay also for this!! ...) anyway the old men was showing us around and taking and talking... his English wasn’t the best.. we couldn’t understand him and after 20 minutes showing us some stuff said he wants 1000 Lkr for ech person. We told him that’s not fair because we thought it was included in the ticket price - 1500 lkr.. obviously it wasn’t. We gave him 500lkr for both of us and he left. So be careful on that!!! It’s not included in the tickets. It was our mistake and now we know.But the Temple was nice, I recommend to visit this place. ALONE.",2018/11/01,LenkaKA92,
"This is the most important Temple in SL so a must see in Kandy. Unfortunately we had a very pushy guide who didn't give much explanation but insisted in pushing us into lines, telling us what we would not be interested in, eg the Library which was wonderful, and so our experience was detracted from. It is better to read up by yourself and go at your own pace.",2018/11/01,Roselilyoz,Australia
"We asked for a tour guide who gave us a nice overview of the temple. You will be asked to take off your shoes which is actually a nice experience- don’t stress it. Make sure shoulders and knees are covered (men and women). Go ahead and purchase some offering flowers for 100SLR and place it at the offering table and marvel at the history, beauty, and the reverence towards faith! Ask before you take photos- do not take photos with the Buddha statues and keep your back to the statue.",2018/11/01,MadleneM,"Yerevan, Armenia"

"This is an excellent, well maintained and interesting site. The walkways, steps and handrails are in good condition, so you feel safe even when scaling the side of the rockface!We arrived at about 9.30am, I wouldn't recommend setting off much later as it does get really hot during the climb and there aren't many opportunities for shade. Either that or leave it until late afternoon (out of wet monsoon season) when it cools down again.We had a very informative guidebook which we used to navigate our way around. There are several 'guides' hanging around offering their services. There isn't much in the way of information boards or reading material, so I do feel you would miss out on a lot of information without either a guide or a guide book.During the walk up to the top of lion rock there are several points of interest and viewing platforms to break up the journey and give you chance for a breather.Depending on how you arrive at the site be sure to check which route down to take - we came in our own car, so parked at the main entry car park, there is another car park which tourist vehicles/coaches etc are driven round to once they dropped visitors off - there are signs directing down to the 'foreigners car park' which leads you past a plethora of stalls selling all manner of, dare I say, tourist tat! This turned out to be the wrong route out for us and we had a bit of a walk back to our car park.Overall an excellent site, I highly recommend a visit here, if you're on a tight time deadline and only have time for a few stops in the 'cultural triangle' this should be one of them!",2018/10/31,RuthyTunes,Asia
"This fort is one of the world famous place. You can have nice experience there. This was named as 8th wonder of the world because still couldn't find the technology how they got water up to that rock from the river. There is a water park which is made in 5th century. Still that water flowers are working in rainy season. You can climb top of the mountain. That way is so much nice and amazing. You can see world famous arts of ""Wijjulatha and Megalatha"". For local tourist entrance is 50 rupee and for foreigners 30 dollers.On top of the mountain there is a ancient fort made by king Kashyapa.

There were no massive hills to climb but the path was wet and muddy in some parts - do bear this in mind if you’re planning to visit in wet season as we did! It was a really beautiful walk and the view from World’s End was stunning.

As is often the case with many museums, this information is often lacking at other displays and you have to rely on guess work or prior knowledge!There is a lovely café by the museum gift shop, with seating outside in the courtyard, which had a very European feel.A visit to the museum leaves you well placed for a stroll around the very pleasant Victoria Park (which we did) and also the adjacent Natural History Museum and art gallery (which we didn't leave time for!)",2018/10/31,RuthyTunes,Asia

The ruins on top of the rock are just the foundation stones and so it's more about the panaromaic views from the top.We went on a Poya day, a full moon holiday, and had a queue for 2.5 hours in the hot sun to reach the top. There were a few frustrating moments with people pushing past, but the wait was worth it in the end.The views from the top are amazing and you can see a blanket of lush forest in all directions.The frescos on the way up are not that interesting and it was just a slow shuffle past in a queue. You can't take photos of them either.

"We planned our trip to Sri Lanka around the opening date for Yala Block 1 and 2, but a month before leaving for our trip we found out Yala was extending their close til the end of October due to limited rain. I guess the bonus was that is was not as busy as we have heard Yala to be when block 1and 2 are open.We were hoping to spot a leopard in Yala. We took a safari to Block 5 Yala, we did a full day safari (whixh was what we were going to do in the bigger block 1 and 2 area). Block 5 is a bit small for a full day safari, we found ourselves covering the same area several times. But we were very lucky, at 12 noonwe spotted a leopard, it was so nice to be the only jeep, we were able to enjoy the experience without disturbance, even though the leopard didnt stay in the open very long. We also spotted many deer, a couple of elephants, mongoose, a number of birds, buffalo and monkeys. We probably should have made the decision to leave after spotting the leopard because we didnt see too much after that and it ended up being a long day.

"The temple is locally known as Sri Dalada Maligawa and houses a Sacred Relic of Tooth of Buddha. The temple is located inside the royal palace complex and is a World Heritage Site. Kandy is a significant pilgrimage center for Buddhist in Sri Lanka and the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic is the primary reason why most Buddhist Pilgrims visit Kandy. The temple also attracts many non Buddhist tourist. During the festival days and holidays, the temple is reportedly very crowded. On other day, like when we visited, there were good number of people visiting the temple, but it was not packed. Most of the crowd, accumulates at the temple during the evenings prayer time, when the Sacred Tooth Relic is displayed to people.There is an entry ticket for foreigners to enter the temple complex. There is good arrangement to keep the footwear, a separate one for the foreigners and at the entrance all the ticket holders are given an envelope containing CD, which has information about the temple.The Tooth Relic is housed inside a Golden Caskets. the main shrine consist of two floors and the pilgrims/ tourists gather on the first floor to get the glimpse of the casket.

"Firstly, one needs to be fully covered to enter. Shorts are not allowed. Which is as per customs, so no complaining...There is an entry charge (half for SAARC countries, free for locals), that bites a bit. Even Indians are charged, inspite of Buddha's origin there.... all in all, with due respect to religion, tradition, beliefs and customs, the place is well milked on tourism aspect. My rating is impacted just for this.The temple is big on the outside, but the inner sanctum view area is congested. People tend to linger on for a better and longer view... the latter happens, the former doesnt. The sanctum area leads on to the history depicting paintings that are detailed ti some extent, but i didnt see how the tooth reluc reached this temple. Photography is prohibited inside, but tourists were randomly clicking away. In fact some tourist guides were actively suggesting how to hold the cameras for clicking secretly... well well, rules are meant to be broken... but here in the temple??There are rites and traditions involved. Handing over lotus flowers, lighting candles, drum beats and all. A very festive atmosphere.The temple is all about Buddha's left tooth that survived the cremation, and was picked up by a disciple... and its journey through the lands and hands of people before finally resting safely here. That is of some significance in the worlds known history..Taking a guide may help, but i felt it was self explanatory. We missed the museum as it closed before we reached the entrance. At 1925 hrs they said the museum closed at 1930 hrs. Not sure how to read it. Would have helped if they stated last entry at 1900 hrs or whatever...If you are in Kandy, a visit to this temple is a must do.No photos taken, so none submitted :)",2018/10/26,VijayKA_on_a_trip,"Bengaluru, India"

I have been to quite a few monasteries around the world but this will definitely rate as one of the best alongside Tooth relic in Kandy and Wat Po in Bangkok. The temple has 2 campuses. One is located in an old house which doesn’t look impressive from outside but inside it’s totally different. The other one is located in the middle of the lake and is amazingly beautiful.

"Easy choice, pay the cash and climb up or sit in a restaurant in town and see from there. Get there at 7am when the ticket office opens and avoid the tour busses. You do not want to walk up here behind a crowd of people begging for mercy half way up! It isn't that hard but being stuck behind people in the midday heat would not be fun! We arrived at the ticket office just after 7am and scampered past a couple of groups through the gardens. There were maybe 5 people at the top when we got there. Great views, enjoy",2018/10/25,BearandJackie,"Sydney, Australia"

This was a fabulous experience from start to end. I myself found it really hard climbing the steps of which there are over a 1000. Sadly I couldn’t make it to the top but nearly well in fact to the lions feet’s area. My husband and our guide went to the top and he said it was such an experience. There are many people to guide you up the steps but beware you must be prepared to tip them. We saw much wildlife there to including a crocodile on the lake and plenty of monkeys. Definitely worth a visit. Ensure you wear a hat and good shoes.,2018/10/25,140AngelaL,"Abergele, United Kingdom"
"Two weeks ago I had a chance to climb the Sigiriya Citadel. There are many who feel that it should be declared the 8th wonder of the world - I agree.The climb of 1225 steps is awe inspiring (but not for those scared of heights). Half way up I visited the Mirror Wall and saw temple paintings that were thousands of years old. At the first level there are also the famous lion feet. From the top you can see for miles and explore the citadel palace remains.I was out of breath when I arrived but soon gained it back, only to loose my breath again because of the incredible view. When you go, take sensible shoes, water and sun block. Climb early as well to avoid the midday heat.All I can say is go - you will not be sorry.",2018/10/25,davidbC5661XV,"Alexandria, United States"

I think the main reason why most people come to Kandy is because they want to see the Temple of Tooth.

It is a short walk and hence managed to continue without burning our feet.The tour guide went with is not a buddhist and was somewhat sceptic about this place of worship.Overall I would say it is a nice historic place due to the history attached to it.We were not able to see the relic display as it happens only at particular time of the day.The ambience is certainly serene inside. It was not very crowded at the time that we went (midday).Some old floor slabs were still preserved.

They were eager to go on weekend, as some five minutes later, half an hour before 17H00, most of them were on the run.Bad service to Sri Lanka, that is a warm welcoming and interesting country.Therefore my evalaution reflects the service and not the museum contents .... what is a shame.",2018/10/24,Zebiko,"Lisbon, Portugal"

The beach is also full of rubbish and derbis which no one seems to take responsibility for. I'm not sure about the rest of the year but in October its also fairly impossible to swim in the sea here as the sea is so rough and the currents are too strong.

But not for the unfit..cost for a family of 5 entry was 18000 Sri lankan rupees, a guide was another 2000 but really worth the explanation of all the historic boulders and sites. There are 1200 steps up to climb..some quite steep..and 800 steps down. The views of the top are truly spectacular with all the palace grounds and water wells and terraced /rock/water gardens to view on the way.

The mass of information will take days to digest. The entrance fee of LKR 300 can be used to visit the Seema Malaka nearby. The method of collecting and keeping footwear at the entance is a model which should be emulated by all places of worship. You are offered plastic trays in to which you can dump the footwear without using hands and thus maintaining a high sanitation quotient while entering a place of worship.

"The National Museum should be a mandatory visit for every single student in Sri Lanka, in order for them not to forget where they come from and not to forget their origins, which they should be proud of. It gives a nice overview and comprehensive summary of the entire history, through colonisation and independence. However, the building itself could certainly do with some urgent refurbishments, because otherwise the picture of the museum building might end up in a museum.Indications are easy to follow, but the staff in every single hall should be a bit more energetic. They all were either seated on their little chair (I do understand that standing up the entire day is not easy), or they were on their personal phones or they were chatting with a colleague from the hall next to them.The poorest part was definitely the little museum shop, where some books were available, as well as some post cards.

To make it worse the only ATM from BOC is only accepting certain but not all credit cards!That was the end of my visit to the world famous Lions Rock.The other problem is the very poor mobile phone coverage in the Sirigiya area.

"Sigiriya is stunning. There's a small museum, of minor interest, by the car park, and then a walk through parkland, with lakes and gardens. It's probably about 10 minutes' walk to the base of the rock. Get used to steps: there are loads, and it's quite a climb. It's not impossible, but you certainly know about it. And be warned: some of the steps are metalwork pinned to the vertical side of the rock. If (like me) heights bother you, they are guaranteed to get to you. But, whatever you do, go to the top. It's absolutely stunning: right up with the very loveliest places I've been to.",2018/10/18,James_Tringham,"Sheffield, United Kingdom"

There are two metal, spiral staircases (one up and one down) to see the preserved paintings on the side of the rock. My legs got a little shaky on those! Then there are many stairs up to the rock itself, these are stone and not too bad. The stairs up to the top of the rock are metal and fastened to the side of the rock. They were very sturdy but if you have a fear of heights, this part might bother you. There isn't much shade at the top but the views are amazing! Don't forget to bring water.

My face was red as a beet when I returned to the parking lot and my t-shirt soaked with sweat after 2 hours. Now that I scared you, you don't want to miss the climb to the top. The frescoes are beautiful (half way up), and the palace on the top interesting, but not as wonderful as the breeze that flows over the top. The view over the jungle is breathtakingly beautiful. Come early in the morning when it is still cooler and bring water. Bring good closed shoes for hiking. Some steps are sharp and ruined my sandals.",2018/10/13,culehmann,"Baltimore, Maryland"
Sitting proudly among some of the tallest peaks in Sri Lanka the Horton Plains is a vital ecological system for the country. During holidays this could be very crowded with local visitors.

"Came to visit this temple last month. Make sure shoulders and knees are covered, even men! I was dressed ok in a T-shirt and trousers, but my partner had shorts that just showed his knees slightly. He wasn’t allowed in. There are various shops nearby selling clothes or material to cover up, but be careful. A friendly old man took us to a shop, tried to get us to buy an expensive sarong, but we left with a very reasonable piece of material. My partner tipped the man for being kind. The man then walked back to the temple with us and started pointing things out and telling us the history. We thought he was just being nice and was grateful for the tip. At the end, we were going to give him some more money anyway, but he demanded $30 each from us! We didn’t ask for a tour, and didn’t actually want one. It was so awkward and left a bit of a sour taste in our mouths. We paid him some money, but not what he demanded. When we left another nicely dressed man approached us, making conversation, but turned out to be trying to get us to buy something or go on some tour. This was the worst area for people trying to rip you off! The temple was quite nice, but expensive. Careful not to burn your feet on the hot stone floors! I wouldn’t come again, and I’m a person that loves monasteries.",2018/10/13,Holliester,

We really wanted to snorkel and surf when we got to Hikkaduwa but unfortunately we were told the coral reef has been destroyed so the snorkeling isn't brilliant - we nearly decided to go anyway but after 1 day of seeing people go in to the sea with their snorkel and come out 10 minutes later we decided not to bother. The beach itself is nice and you can walk along and go into restaurants and bars. We also wanted to surf - but we were near the corner of the beach (stayed in Hikka Trans by Cinnamon) and there were 2 different wave patterns so it wasn't brilliant for surfing either.... this could be just where we were though and the time of year!!

"This is a key element of any cultural tour of Sri Lanka. It looks stunning from a distance and though best to come early, the best photos are in the pm when the sun has risen (they are also the ones used in the promotional literature). The trick is visit the site then take the distance shots afterwards.The site itself involves quite a climb and is best done with a proper guide (not the guys who are looking for money to help you up the steps) as they can explain the history as you go up.There are levels and you can decide to stop at wherever works for you. At the very top there are stunning views across the landscape though little remains of the early palaces it’s still a great place to muse at what it once looked like and how on earth they brought the bricks up that rock.On the way down there is still lots to see including the impressive cobras head cave.Ticket wise it looks as though you can book in advance online which would be well worth doing",2018/10/08,SteveJ420,"London, United Kingdom"

We also came upon elephant poo (there are two elephants in the reserve).If you are very interested in spotting the birds you’ll know you need to come early in the morning but if not you can still see a decent number as we did.As it was the rainy season we got soaked on the walk back; I’ve never been so wet; but it still good to experience.,2018/10/08,SteveJ420,"London, United Kingdom"

Kandy became one of sacred city known as Lord Buddha Tooth Relic located in here. Annually many Buddhists worship this tooth relic.

The views from the top are lovely, as they are on the climb.When you get to the top, there is no shade at all, so ensure you take plenty of water, hat and an umbrella if need be.This is absolutely suitable for children and the older generation alike as the only requirement is to wear trainers and be relatively fit.",2018/10/07,Speeshal,"London, United Kingdom"

"Get here before 10.30am to make sure you can be part of the procession of people making an offering at the main chamber. The queue is long. There is an entrance fee of Rp1500 per pax + Rp100 per storage of shoes. There will be unofficial tour guide that will help you gain the best experience from this place. I say it was worth it because we get to know the place better and made our time effective by being able to see the main areas of the temple. We took our time to explore only when the unofficial tour ended. The tour guide will showed us the important areas and the significance of each one through a mixture of storytelling and amazing facts. He asked for USD20. We felt it was money well spent. Do buy an offering which starts at Rp100 to bring along for the visit. You can get them outside before the entrance.

"This was our final activity on our 5 day Sri Lankan tour. Having visited Udawalawe the day before it was interesting to see the massive differences in the landscapes of the park, Yala being far more green and jungle like. Half of the park is closed in Sept and Oct due to the dry season and mating season, therefore we went through Gate 5 which remained open. Thus is nature, we saw limited animals, mainly spotted deer, peacocks, a few monkeys, mongoose, green bee eaters and wild boar, but nothing of the elephants, bears or leopards inside the park. It was a shame but definitely not a wasted trip as it’s brilliant seeing where they live. On the way to and from the park we did see some elephants at the road side, they were spread out a little and some were slightly more inquisitive than others, especially when they tried to steal my sunglasses. I wouldn’t advise taking any food with you as they will try and stick their trunk in through your car/jeep window to get it. The guides clearly know the park well, it’s a comfortable off-reading experience and they all try to help each other out saying whether they’ve seen anything or not when they pass.

"1500 SLR for admission into the temple. We arrived just after 6:00pm. It wasn’t packed. It is a place of worship so shoes were to be removed. We were advised to cover up by our guide prior to going so long pants / long sleeve shirt. All shoes are held in a security room. Fortunately I had a spare plastic bag so I carried our shoes and didn’t leave them. It looked like chaos when people were returning to collect their shoes. There are some areas where photographs cannot be taken so those rooms become a distant memory. The queues to the offering room went forever. We had an offering of a flower basket we purchased at the entry point. The monk accepting the offerings looked perturbed as we didn’t give cash donations. Don’t feel obligated to offer cash. Some people walked on by without any offerings. As the saying goes ‘beggers can’t be choosers’ so if you don’t wish to offer anything, you shouldn’t feel obligated to, having seen some people with no offerings and us looking shunned upon for doing / giving what many others did - a basket of flowers.

Firstly, it isn’t a nice gentle stroll, it’s 9km of rough terrain. Wear proper shoes ideally with grip, not flip flops like some seemed too. There is rocks to climb over, uneven floors, steep hills and tree roots to contend with. Take water. It gets thirsty work. The views are brilliant and so enjoy them whilst you drink it.

"We visited Yala National Park with Yala Kings Safaris. We chose Yala Kings because of the reviews and the promptness of the responses on emails and clarity of what we were going to get and how much it was going to cost. My interactions with Tharindu, the boss, were all very professional, right up to the evening before we departed, when he emailed to advise the name of our driver, Tharanga. I had read some awful reviews of Yala Park and the way jeeps were speeding around the park and that people who visited did not see hardly any animals. After our experience with Tharanga, I put that down to either a rushed safari or an inexperienced driver. Tharanga has 23 years experience showing visitors into Sri Lanka’s national parks, and this was clearly evident during our trip. While we sat at a water hole for 10 mins and observed a dozen different animals that Tharanga just kept finding, other jeeps stopped for a minute and then drove on. We chose a full day safari and it was worth every rupee. We stopped near the ocean for a morning break and at the river for lunch during the mandatory two hour period where vehicles must not move around the park. We also visited on the last day, ie Friday August 31st before the park closes for two months because of the dryness. The lack of water did not stop Tharanga finding us the following; 3 leopards, a sloth bear that came right along side the Jeep, elephants, heaps of water buffalo, monkeys, deer, boar, monitor lizards, cameleon lizards, birds of all types including birds of prey, mongoose, crocodiles, peacocks, and lots more. Tharanga was so adept at spotting animals, that what appeared to be a tree branch, was in fact a crocodile or a lizard. I read about a family who took a 3 yo child with them and then complained about the roads being rough. My goodness, this is the bush, the jungle, the outback! You need to immerse yourself in it to appreciate its beauty and what it has to offer. If you don’t like tasting a bit of dust, or getting thrown around a bit on 4x4 tracks, then simply don’t go. During our break by the river, which is a beautiful spot with full toilet facilities, Tharanga provided us with a curry lunch, fresh fruit and water. So, a final word, do your research, choose a company who has knowledgeable drivers who can really make your trip something to remember, as Yala Kings did for us. Thankyou to the Yala Park Management who were out and about ensuring drivers were obeying park rules.",2018/10/05,emtnems,Australia
"We almost didn’t come here because a traveller we met said how treacherous part of the walk was - what nonsense! This was a delightful, straightforward walk that can be done in an hour and a half or from beginning to end and back again. We were staying in Ella main town, and from there we just walked down Passara Rd until we saw the trail for Little Adam’s Peak begin. No need to take a tuk-tuk, the the walk is only 10 minutes to the start, if that. The walk itself was very pleasant, starts off very easy, just a mild elevation as you walk through tea plantations, then gets steeper as you walk up the hill. There are parts which are quite rocky and you do need to walk carefully so I’d recommend wearing trainers rather than sandals. That being said, people of all shapes and sizes were managing it, including families with small children.The views themselves were lovely. You can see far across Ella, and it’s a great way to soak in all the tea plantations around you. Overall, in terms of how straightforward the walk was and the views you get from doing it, I’d give this a full 5 stars and recommend that anyone visiting Ella come and do this walk.",2018/10/05,Chabawacci,"London, United Kingdom"

"Having walked down beautiful Adam’s Peak, been mesmerized by the scenery in Ella, soaked in the ambience of Tangalle and Mirissa, Hikkaduwa was not only a huge disappointment, but also felt dreadfully unsafe.Whilst Tangalle and Mirissa were lined with the flora and fauna of Sri Lanka, there were a few coconut trees in Hikkaduwa, but mostly the view is of delapidated, eery, empty hotels. Unlike elsewhere where you could easily get delicious Sri Lankan food for a good price, this place was full of naff restaurants serving expensive Western food, and poor quality at that. Perhaps the most difficult thing is the large groups of local men just wandering around gawking at tourists and in particular hassling women. Having travelled lots of the South for two weeks we expected some people to peddle their wares, but this was constant and at times quite aggressive. At one point whilst I was trying to read my book I had to tell somebody to back away because he was pestering so much. Hardly relaxing.In terms of the tourist population, whilst in other places it was full of backpackers travelling around, here it was mostly what seemed to be people on package deals just here for the beach. Unfortunately, it did give it quite a chavvy vibe and felt somewhat cheap but not cheerful, and not actually even cheap!*Perhaps most distressing was the ‘turtle watching’* Basically, a group of Sri Lankan guys encourage large sea turtles onto the shore (possibly captured and brought in) and feed them seaweed to keep them close. If tourists were to feed them seaweed they have to pay a fee. I gather if they dont pay they get quite intimidating. These tourists then go up to these beautiful creatures and distress them by petting them and taking pictures with them. It really is heartwrenching to see, and astounding how oblivious so many tourists are to how awful this practice is.Sri Lanka has so much beauty and excitement to offer - thank goodness I only spent one day here as it doesn’t show you how great Sri Lanka is. I would discourage anyone from visiting this place.",2018/10/04,Chabawacci,"London, United Kingdom"

Was shocked by the price of entry sitting at $41USD per person but more so by the shonky USD to rupee conversion which occurred at the ticket counter. Not a great way to promote tourism.,2018/10/02,Shani32,
"Very hot but worth the long drive and heatAmazing history, and geological featureThe staircase was daunting over 1000 stairs be aware of men trying to help women up the stairs as they will be asking for $$$$Make sure you wear decent walking shoes , take a hat and sunscreen and water!!!",2018/10/02,travelbugs20143,"Melbourne, Australia"
Definitely don't miss this incredible architectural wonder. Pay for a guide so you get the full historical story behind this incredible achievement. The walk is not as difficult as I had feared especially if you take it slowly. Well worth the effort.,2018/10/02,Lisa R,Sunshine coast
"Reached the gate before sunrise, but had to queue up for a ticket nonetheless. They don't return small changes, but the views and cool winds are worth the money. Can be done in 3 hours, but you could easily spend a day or two here and not be bored.",2018/10/02,Nirjhar B,
We did this walk with our 4 teenage kids. Left Nuwara E at 0515. Bit of a windy road to the ticket place (which I think opens at 6). Paid the usual overpriced fee (SL knows how to milk the tourists). Then the walk was great. Quite scenic but pretty easy as it’s mostly flat. The view at worlds end is very impressive and a nice place to have breakie. We were back relaxing at our hotel at 11. We were lucky with the weather. It probs wouldn’t be worth it if the weather was no good.,2018/10/02,HTDXDM,"Sydney, Australia"
"Beaches spread several kilometres south of Bentota. Beaches are clean, water clear and sand soft. Good place to learn surfing.

This could be a beautiful beach but it is very polluted. Such a shame. We went for a nice walk along the beach but I chose not to swim cos of all the litter. We swam at the hotel pool instead.,2018/10/02,mrstueyrowrza,"Wyndham, Australia"
"The Galle Fort is of great historic significance and has Dutch and British influences. Set against pristine waters of the Indian ocean , the Galle fort covers a long coast line with a Light House and a clock tower. There is a local market to buy Local arts and crafts. Some great food choices with many restaurants serving local and continental cuisine. The Galle Cricket Stadium is in the back drop. The fort area is well connected to the city center and is about 2 1/2 hours from the colombo airport.

"Go early, leave about 5.30-6am so you can see the sunrise it’s worth it. Most incredible views if it’s clear, from all angles. Easily the best attraction in Ella. Lots of cute dogs up there too :)",2018/10/02,Caitlin J,
"Easy walk if you like stairs. It's one path up and the same path down. Sure, there are other routes but you can't get lost.

"Very easy and nice walk. The view is beautiful
Recommended to go very early in the morning for best visability",2018/10/02,michalmatalon,"Haifa District, Israel"
This is a lovely activity while visiting Ella. The walk to the top takes you through a beautiful tea plantation and offers beautiful views from the peak. The walk is not too strenuous and offers a gateway to then walk to the nine arches bridge. Look up train times so you can try to be at the bridge to see a passing train.,2018/10/02,mrstueyrowrza,"Wyndham, Australia"
Temple of the tooth relic is a unique and a must place in Kandy who come to visit Kandy.temple of the tooth relic is also the palace of the last King who was in Kandy King Sri Wickrama Raja Sinha.A definite place that anybody will never forget in their life time.,2018/10/02,Thilina21,"Kandy, Sri Lanka"
"I was unimpressed. Very pricey ticket and ""officials"" at entrances who were quite hostile. The entrance fee gives you admission to a number of other museums on the site but these close earlier than the temple and no one informed us of this when we bought the ticket despite the fact that we asked. As others have said a lot of money to ""see"" a tooth that isn't there. I think my time would have been better spent elsewhere.",2018/10/02,Jenny M,
"The temple is lovely, be aware to wear modest clothing, legs covered etc. It is a must see for Sri Lanka and its really interesting. Its worth a visit regardless if you're into history. To enter the temple you must remove your shoes, I removed socks also but be aware it's very hot underfoot so may be worth leaving socks on.",2018/10/02,Ben C,
"We managed to go on a busy day with plenty of people all dressed in white.Absolutely fantastic temple which takes around 2 hours to see.Monks float in and out of rooms, texts are on display and the story of Budda is depicted in paintings around one room.It is a working temple, so be prepared that people are worshipping there.Shoes can be left in the shoe counter for a reasonable rate.Take the correct change of 1,500 rupees per person for entry to make it quicker getting in.I really recommend a guide to show you around, they cost around Rs.1500 - Rs. 2000.",2018/10/02,173peteb,"Greater London, United Kingdom"
"We went to the beach to watch sea turtles and were disgusted by the experience. We went there early morning, to find a group of 4 Sri Lankan men very aggressively asking for money for them to go and get the turtles out of the sea. We stayed there about an hour and this is how it works: those men stay on the beach and ask for money, they make sure you can’t go too close to the water and if a sea turtle tries to come on the beach, they scare it away back to the water to make sure you don’t see it until you pay. One of them had a knuckle duster and showed it to a tourist that was trying to find turtles with some seaweeds. A couple of tourists paid to see one, they took them in the water to make sure the rest of us would not see anything from the beach. The sea was rough and it looked like the couple did not know how to swim and was very uncomfortable, they apparently managed to get a turtle come and say hi to them for 10 sec and that was it. They also tricked some other tourists for paying 200 roupies, and once the turtle was approaching, they asked 2000 roupies. When the tourists said no, that was not the price, then they scared the turtle back to the water. Please do not go and do not pay as it entertains their business!!!",2018/10/01,Aimi-Asia,"Singapore, Singapore"

"We came here a few weeks ago on our first morning in Sri Lanka. We read all the advice about going at 7am, but we didn’t arrive at our hotel until 10pm the night before, after travelling for 30 hours, so we had a bit of a lie in and went at 11.30am. It was also a local bank holiday.Even still, we didn’t find the place that busy at all. A lot of the time we were climbing stairs on our own. Luckily, as at times I had to stop, as my legs were on fire. It was a nice walk but tiring on the thighs.Make sure you take some water with you!The views from the top are amazing. You can see for miles in every direction, and the old city is really interesting to walk around. I would definitely do this again!",2018/10/01,Holliester,
We spent a lovely couple of hours here just wandering around. Headed straight down and then followed road round to the left to take us up to the lighthouse.

"We stayed here for a couple of nights. We enjoyed the relaxed vibe and being able to stroll along the beach to have dinner and a few lion beers in the afternoon while we watched the waves at one of the many shore lined bars and restaurants. The waves were small and so we went up the road a couple of km to Weligama beach for a surf. We were lucky to see a turtle come ashore to lay her eggs one night out the front of one of the restaurants. Unfortunately, it was a shame to see her have to turn around and go back to the water after tourists surrounded her taking photos and she couldn’t get far enough up the beach away from the tide to lay. A beautiful beach that I hope will not become too overrun with tourists.",2018/10/01,movershaker84,"Airlie Beach, Australia"
Loads of fabulous bars along the beach that do a great happy hour. The sunset was gorgeous and there was such a lovely atmosphere. Would highly recommend a drink along the beach at night.,2018/10/01,michelleq332,
This temple delivers all that you would expect from such a highly religous place. Lots to see and experience and very busy with locals and tourists. Well worth a visit.,2018/10/01,garp_kaz,"Oxfordshire, United Kingdom"
If you go to Kandy - it is a beautiful place - then you have to go to the temple. It was very busy and touristy but I understand why. It is a place that Buddhists hold very sacred and should be respected and appreciated.We had a guide - which I think is a good idea - but we went through at great speed. I would have liked to have done this in my time and gone where my feet took me.,2018/10/01,546samanthas,"Melbourne, Australia"

Make sure to dress decently as they won't allow you in otherwise",2018/10/01,ndashikaa,"Colombo, Sri Lanka"
This is quite an amazing temple with lots of beautiful artefacts and artwork etc. The line of devotees want to make an offering was incredible. Very crowded though and if you are feeling 'templed out' you could afford to miss this one. Also if it is a wet day/night you arrive back at the shoe depository and have no way of drying your feet before putting on shoes and socks.,2018/10/01,Luv2Bonholidays,Wangaratta

"Sigiriya - Lion Rock is one of the major tourist attraction of Srilanka which is located about 18 Kms from Dambulla town. You travel towards Trincomalee from Colombo / Kandy and after 10 kms, from Dambulla, you take a road on the right to Sigiriya Lion rock which is about 8 kms from that point. There will be sign boards indicating the direction. The place opens to visitors at 7 a.m. and I suggest that you do it at the time so that it will be less hot when you reach the top and then can spend more time up there if you want to. We visited at 8.40 .a.m. on a Saturday. The crowd was just coming in. When there is a crowd you will be held up while climbing since some of steps will be very narrow and you can climb only in a single file. The ticket counter is near the museum.Visit the museum first and then proceed to the Lion rock. There is also wash room facilities near the ticket counter and this is the only facility for toilet in the location. So ease yourself before you start your climb. Also carry water bottle with you, and snacks if you need to have a bite. The whole trip up and down the rock and the garden will take about 2 -3 hours depending on your fitness to climb and the time you want to spend in each site en-route and on top. I am unused to walking. Hardly walks 1 km a day and am several kgs overweight but still did make the climb in 90 minutes with several breaks for resting in-between. If you need take a guide but take an authorized guide. There are so many so call self proclaimed guide trying to offer their services to you. Once you have your ticket and you enter through the main gate you will come across the garden. Take your time in visiting these before you embark on your climbing since most of the time on the return after climbing you will be tired and the desire to see the garden might be less. You will not get lost or take a wrong turn so just keep following the crowd. Take your time when you are climbing. Rest whenever you want to. The journey or climb is as important as the top. You will have lot of spots, during the climb, from where you have views and want to take photos. Half way to the top you need to climb us a spiral staircase to visit a cave where there are murals. You will have to climb down the spiral and proceed with your climb. You can avoid this part if you want to. The last part of the climb is steep and narrow. People will be coming down the same way so you can climb in only a single file in this part. Take a good break, if you need it, before doing this climb since if you stop while climbing you will hold the line (though there are spots as in turns that you can let others pass but they are very narrow).Once you reach the top you will have 360 degree view. There will be no shade in the top. So if you do not want to stand in the sun for a long time then you have start early or visit late in the day by 3.30 or 4.00 p.m. Sigiriya is climbable.If it is just climbing and 360 degree view from the top you are looking for you can then climb Pidurangala Rock which is close to Sigiriya though you will not have so many things to see.like in Sigiriya but I believe it does not cost this much (though I have not been there)",2018/09/30,Balaji J,"Sharjah, United Arab Emirates"
One of the most talked about things to see and do in Sri Lanka... and now I know why.Yes... you must climb to the top of this incredibly ancient historical site. The views are to die for. Just wander around and absorb the amazing history and visit the museum.Breathtaking.,2018/09/30,JazzyPerth,"Perth, Australia"

"We stayed within the fort so it was very easy to wander around and take in the sights. The walls are well preserved and the streets are full of heritage buildings, the Portuguese and Dutch flavours of architecture ever present. As you wander down the streets there are numerous little boutique shops to have a nosey in, the prices are definitely a little hiked up. Cafes and Restaurants also pop up in all the streets. The walk along the top of the fort wall is beautiful, looking out over the ocean, the water very clear, fish are visible, although it is sad to see the odd thong/flip flop floating past and the plastic debris thats been carelessly discarded into the ocean. While the occasional tuk tuk driver would ask you if you needed their services, we were not bombarded like we have been out on the streets, there are also only a couple of stalls for gifts/clothes etc, basically not many bargains to be had, some of the shops were really quite expensive.",2018/09/30,SusanP429,"Brisbane, Australia"
A very steep and narrow climb in parts but well worth it. An amazing view of Lion Rock. Much cheaper to climb than Lion Rock.,2018/09/30,230sue,"Devon, United Kingdom"
We walked through the Town and then up into the hills. The climb is very easy to start but towards the summit it gets really steep. There are 100 plus steps close to the top which slow you up a bit.There are three peaks and the views are spectacular. Well worth the effort of the walk.,2018/09/30,Steve D,"Caerleon, United Kingdom"
This is an easier climb than others but in some parts rather narrow.  Various view points once at the top and well worth the climb.,2018/09/30,230sue,"Devon, United Kingdom"
"I can only describe this as a Woodland walk. When you enter the Forest there is a notice that gives you directions to all the different lengths of walks. The walk we did was not hilly but was easy. On the way there was a superb viewing point overlooking Kandy. I think we spent around 1.5 hours in the Forest and we saw deer, birds, butterflies and monkeys.",2018/09/30,Steve D,"Caerleon, United Kingdom"
It really is a nice Temple with a very interesting history. The atmosphere in the Temple is serene and the decoration is superb. It was bombed by the Tamils in recent history and the story around this episode is fascinating. All in all well worth a visit.,2018/09/30,Steve D,"Caerleon, United Kingdom"
Part of the must do places to visit in Sri Lanka. The sacred tooth relic is well hidden and hard to gauge where it actually is! Some lovely elephant mouldings and golden lotus flower decorations. Do need to have knees and shoulders covered and take your socks as the ground is very hot and unbearable barefoot!,2018/09/30,_logan_sharon,"Colchester, United Kingdom"

This is a must see for all visitors to Kandy even though it is a holy place for Buddhists. The buildings and ambience is just gorgeous. We really enjoyed our time there. You don't need to spend a long time but it is well worthwhile spending 1-2 hours.,2018/09/30,AnthonyPPerth,"Perth Hills, Australia"
It’s peaceful inside the temple and you would feel that you are seeing something very important. If you are going on Wednesday there is a free distribution of holy water after the symbolic bath of the Tooth Relic. It's a must visit place in Sri lanka.,2018/09/30,Unnikrishnan B,"Thrissur, India"
We didn't even get to see the inside of this temple as the people on the gate determined that my wife's knee length skirt was inappropriate. Sri Lankan women who were similarly attired were admitted. It was no use arguing. While westerners are charged a whopping 1500 rupee entrance fee Asians are given a discount and I believe Sri Lankans pay nothing at all,2018/09/30,Giswitch,"Sunderland, United Kingdom"
Seen nicer temples than this one. You can't see the tooth and it is very expensive so not really worth it unless you religiously want to be there.,2018/09/30,anni27ch,"Giessen, Germany"
1200 or steps with railing is a lot better than some places where you climb over steep boulders and uneven steps. The moment you are on your way up to the rock you are hit with a barrage of touts wanting to help you up the stairs. They are not guides as some reviewers say. Just be polite and keep looking straight ahead and say no thank you. No need to be rude. I usually help my wife on climbs but in this instance I struck a deal with one of them and for 2000 rupees it was well worth it. Less stress on both of us and he knew how to hold her and help her up and down. So if you really want to climb Lion rock and feel this is helpful it really doesn't cost much in the great scheme of things. They know their targets which are older people. Enjoy the climb and the rock art.,2018/09/29,BigAl55Melbourne,"Melbourne, Australia"
Visiting this was well worth the payment. Amazing views. Great history. Plenty to see on the way up and down. Monkeys and beautiful grounds to picnic in. Take a hat as the sun is very hot and plenty of sunscreen.,2018/09/29,Frredrik777,Brisbane

"It makes no sense. Round the world experts and I use the word ‘expert’ very lightly have placed us in Bentota for 7 whole nights! Supposedly it’s a good idea because of the beach and so many amazing water sports on the beach. Well so far we’ve found we cannot swim on the beach due to very rough tides and jelly fish, there isn’t any water sports on the beach, only the smelly lake and all they want to do is rip you off! £45 for 15 mins on a jet ski...really? It’s £95 at home for 2 hours in the actual sea going around seeing caves and beautiful islands like Herm and Sark. I’m totally upset that we have been left here for 7 days and have another 4 to go!If anyone has any idea where we can swim on a clean decent part of the beach please let me know but I didn’t pay for a month in Sri Lanka to sit around permanently, eating and being ripped off to look at nature, which should be free anyway! Not impressed with any of this place so far. It’s completely over rated.My teenagers spent most of the time on his phone and that’s when we can even get reliable WiFi which is meant to be included everywhere you go! Really disappointing holiday all round. Don’t come to Sri Lanka for more than 7-10 days and don’t spend more than 2 nights in any place. It’s the same thing in every place you go apart from Nuwara Eliyah which is very green and cold. Still the same activities everywhere you go. Pretty dull tbh.

Our driver worked his butt off looking for another leopard, and at around 5pm, after waiting for an hour, one emerged from the bush. He knew the leopard was there because of the calls of the peacocks which he called the leopard alarm clock. Got the image and thrilled to see a leopard in the wild in Sri Lanka.

"I didn't know about this place before I go there. When I stay at a hotel in Uswetakeiyawa my guide and driver Mr Mihiraj suggested me to do that. We started 8 am from the hotel 1. first we visited Negombo fish market. 2. We visited whole Negombo for 4 hours including Negombo fort, Eththukala the hotel area, a beach with catamarans, few churches and we drove through beach road to Muthurajawela starting point.I was not hungry and we didn't eat a proper lunch.On the way to Muthurajawela Mihiraj suggested to by some fruits. So we bought some fruits ( A pineapple, guava, water melon and few bananas)We had a picnic lunch at the starting point of Muthurajawela and visited their small museum too. The cruise was nice and I like the starting too. About 3 km we sailed through the Hamilton canal. Both sides of the canal very green and also filled with brackish water. Then we arrived to the famous Negombo lagoon. After sailing through the lagoon we came to the wet land sanctuary called Muthurajawela. At the sanctuary we were able to see many birds, few small crocodiles and some brown monkeys. I enjoyed this visit a lot thanking to Mihiraj. I can recommend Mr Mihiraj as their Driver or guide or transporter for foreign visitors who willing to visit Sri Lanka.I'll write his contact details as a help for future visitors.his email - mihirasuriya@gmail.commy tour with him almost one month now. His charges for transport very reasonable too. He's very careful, knowledgeable and good driver too. As a lady solo traveler I'm totally satisfied with him because of his good care.The fee for Muthurajawela visit was very reasonable and it's really a different and nice experience. The staff of Muthurajawela community center also very friendly and knowledgeable.Thanks everybody",2018/09/27,lyndasmith1000,"Colombo, Sri Lanka"

It was a rainy day so The climb up started with a muddy road in the middle of a tea estate after which a steep climb of steps to the top.

However certainly for my son this was part of the attraction. My middle daughter who has vertigo did not make it up but my 10 year old did...……We saw many elderly people struggle; but even if you can get half way the views before the final ascent are amazing.Once you make it to the top and the thighs have stopped burning it is just incredible. How on earth did they build this citadel???? The views are breathtaking and there is a real sense of accomplishment.The books all say to go first thing; we went first thing and the queues were horrendous. My son and I went back at the end of the day and walked straight up. Other advice would include that you can bypass the enclosed spiral staircase which when crowded is not pleasant. There are frescos which you see but frankly not amazing enough to warrant being hemmed in for an additional 20 mins.,2018/09/25,Jet237927,"Alton, United Kingdom"

"I visited this temple as part of my Intrepid tour. Very lovely place to look at and contains a very good room full of pictures and stories to read. The temple itself is very pretty and the garden areas are lovely. Seeing the locals coming in all dressed in white is a lovely experience. We went for the 9:30 Buddhism ritual with drumming. While that part was great, we were then allowed to go upstairs to view the relic. Again this is just a personal thing but I unfortunately suffered a panic attack due to the tightness of crowds going up the stairs. The relic itself however was very interesting to see and despite my panic, I did see it as a wonderful once-in-a-lifetime experience. (My guide and people on my tour were also great helping me get over it!) Tips: Definitely take shawls, long trousers etc to cover yourself up as there are at least two police checks. One of our group had to purchase a sarong. Take socks as well to protect your feet. We went early but I think some tiles etc could get very hot in the sunshine.

"The ticket cost $ 30.00 including the Lion Rock citadel, the Mirror Wall and the Museum. The gardens around the Rock are well worth walking around. The steps are many but everyone can make it to the top ... if you give yourself the time ... it is well worth stopping on the way up to enjoy the scenaries... plenty of room for people to pass... One mishap we had on the way up is when we reached the frescoes, I took a shot with my camera right at the top of the stairs, I did not see any signs forbidding this until after reaching the platform! ... Of course I got stopped and my camera was taken away from me very rudely and roughly!! ... I insisted that I be the one to delete the photo as I was afraid they would delete all the other photos by accident!!! ... After a 'fight' my daughter was able to grab my camera back and showed them that the photo was deleted ... this negative inter-action really spoiled our mood!! ... The controllers could have been much more polite ... and they should put a big sign up at the bottom of the stairs showing that photography was forbidden! Further up on the platform where one can see the lions paws there is a Red Cross center for those who need some extra help or rest ... nice spot to recuperate before continuing to the top citadel.Once on the top ... breath taking views! Well worth the hike! ... We didn't take a guide but I am sure there was a lot to learn up there! ... We read up most of the information before climbing but it may have been easier to have someone up there to point things out to us...On the way down (a lot shorter than the way up) we really enjoyed walking through the gardens, and woods: lots of wild animals such as monkeys, monitors, birds, iguanas, chipmunks, squirrels etc.",2018/09/23,Myrnamug,"Shenyang, China"

It is definitely not for the faint hearted, but if you are brave enough to experience something new, Sigiriya rock rewards you with incredible rock architecture and one of the best views. The rock used to be a palace for the king, and what a beautiful palace it is!

It reminds me of a cross between Ubud, Bali and St Malo, France with its own unique quirkiness",2018/09/22,H5679ELluciap,"Guernsey, United Kingdom"
"Plenty to see and do. We had a very pleasant stroll around the narrow streets. There are many places of interest and even more places that want to sell you something, so beware you shopaholics.",2018/09/22,Paul B,"Bracknell, United Kingdom"
"I was at the Galle Fort in the first week of February earlier this year. I was visiting the Fort with a few of my friends. The fort is an ancient built by the shore of the city of Galle. One can see a heavy European influence in the fort and it won't be wrong to state that the city of Galle resides pretty much in and around the fort. It is a great sight to see the cricket action from the fort as well. The view of the lighthouse is alright, but I wish it was better maintained. I felt that the fort is oversold as a place to visit by the hotel staff around SL. The walk along the shore to the light house is nice.",2018/09/22,nrm77,"London, United Kingdom"
We had 2 mornings in Sigiriya so we wanted to climb the Pidurangala and Sigiriya rocks on one morning each. Decided to start off with the Pidurangala rock and it was the right choice! The view on top of Pidurangala was so amazing and you...More,2018/09/22,wmwoo,
An easy hike along a well made track.  A slight climb at the end up steps but easily managed.  You are rewarded with a fantastic view.  Very tranquil walk past tea plantations.  Well worth a visit.,2018/09/22,Alison B,
Really beautiful views and a lovely hike to the summit. Definitely worth a visit - and the climb itself isn't too taxing.,2018/09/22,Charlie M,"Stourbridge, United Kingdom"
This is a really lovely walk. It takes under an hour from the village but if you want you take get a tuk tuk to the Flower Garden Guesthouse and start from there. The path goes by the tea plantations where any of the workers coming down are eager to pose for photos _ for a fee. The last bit is a bit steep but there are steps so it's fine.stunning views from the top.,2018/09/22,marinoonan,"Waterford, Ireland"

This temple was dedicated to the tooth relic of the Buddha. It's not huge but is nicely decorated with gold leafed ceiling fixtures and vault doors. It also has a series of historical paintings with captions detailing the history of the temple and the tooth. the setting beside the huge Kandy Lake is also a plus.,2018/09/22,RichardK938,"West Palm Beach, Florida"

"Not sure why this temple is rated so high. You pay $10+ to get into the area that houses the tooth and all you see is a picture of the stupa that houses it and a small door behind which that lays. The grounds do seem to be lovely but it was pouring rain the day we visited and we didn't spend much time in them. Perhaps that's why we were so disappointed. But, hundreds of other reviewers can't all be wrong. A dissenting point of view.",2018/09/22,Edythe,Edmonton
"Went here on a private tour with a guide and it was great. We were given a complete tour lasting about 2 hours, not rushed and plenty of time to take photographs. The guide was really good and informative ( he was optional and well worth the tip for his knowledge ). Pretty big temple and worth a visit. You have to remove your shoes and the floors exposed to the sun get extremely hot, some people wore socks to protect their feet.",2018/09/22,harpo110,"Milford Haven, United Kingdom"
"A must but it is good to have a good guide or to have read about the Buddhist culture of the Island. The lions at the door amongst other things reflect the origin of the Sinhalese name - ‘sinhal’ -“of the lions”.The beauty of the entire temple and its historical part as well as its Japanese, Chinese and other Buddhist contributions are fascinating. Anyone interested in the people and their religion and culture should find this place compelling - for further study and insights.NB! For understandable reasons shoes have to be taken off.",2018/09/22,Bella51,"Perth, Australia"
Excellent place to visit in sri lanka.its a very valuble & beautiful place specialy for foreigners..,2018/09/21,Weekend G,
"I had been to this place with couple of my friends. To begin with entrance fees is around 30 USD for foreigners and SAARC country nationals get 50% discount. The place is crowded and weather was hot. Initial 1 hr we were able to cover only 25% of the total steps due to slow moving heavy crowd, however once we crossed the first level it took us just 20 minutes to reach the top. It is not as tough as it seems, only two things to beware of, fear of heights due to steel steps covering the final acsent to the top and bees, there are lot of bee hives in the rocks. You'll get some good views on top and it's worth an hour of your time.",2018/09/21,vijaychockkalingam,"Chennai, India"
"Around 1200 steps will have you up on top of the rock where the remains of the Palace from 500ad remain today.You can only marvel at the work required to erect the palace in the location including the underground water piping delivering water to the rock. Whilst much of the Palace has been destroyed, the remnants of the palace at the top, the gardens and pools at the base, and the fresco paintings half way up are amazing - such history and endeavour.The walk/climb can be a bit of a challenge due to uneven nature of the stone steps toward the base, then the ladder/circular steps to the fresco (you can avoid this effort), before the final ascent up the stairs - all doable if you take your time.Can be very busy so expect delays & take your time. Once on the top, the remnants are also irregular so care is required whilst getting around. It can also be very windy so make sure you have a secure hat. No facilities along the way so preapre well before departing the entry/car park - toilets, water.There is some facilities when you get down (on way to tourist car park) - souvenirs, ice creams & drinks. Also found the monkeys entertaining.",2018/09/21,188petere,"Brisbane, Australia"
"This was an excellent trip unfortunately we went on a public holiday and it was really really busy. Myself didn't make it too far but my partner went to go to the top with our guide but the queues were just too long ...he did get so far and thoroughly enjoyed it. What I would advise is be wary of the guys who say they are ""tourist helpers"" we asked our guide if they were legit he said yes but at the end of our tour they demanded money...they didn't get what they asked for but we did tip a little as we always do to anyone who helps us, but it put a bit of a dampner on our day, they didn't get nasty but they weren't very pleasant either.",2018/09/21,durhamwitch,county durham
"I guess it's the high expections, but we were slightly underwelmed. It was a nice activity with good views at the tops, but nothing extraordinary. We did like it. We went really early, and started at 7am. Which is nice and highly recommended. Its a doable climb (mostly stairs with good hand rails) but it tends to get busy, when we were going back at around 8;30 it was already very crowded (and it was low season). Some people suggest to do the Pidurangala rock, which indeed is cheaper, but also more difficult (not always stairs and handrails)",2018/09/21,R_Chubster,"The Hague, The Netherlands"
It is definitely worth an early start to climb the rock before it gets too hot. The history of the citadel is fascinating and the views from the top glorious.,2018/09/21,Dianne P,"Hereford, United Kingdom"
"We climbed Sigiriya Rock with our fantastic guide, Sugath, as part of a 4 day tour. He advised we go at about 4pm as even though it would be warmer than early morning, it would be quiet and we could see the sunset from the top. The walk up is steps all the way, some of which are quite narrow and steep, but doable by any able bodied person who doesn't suffer from fear of heights. The cave paintings are worth the extra climb. The top of the rock is large and fairly flat, with great views. No facilities of any kind, though. We admired the sunset, enjoyed the antics of the wild monkeys and descended easily before it was dark, the last people to leave. A very good visit made immeasurably better by our guide giving us information as we went - if you did it alone, there wasn't much information posted to help with explaining the history - you'd have to research that in advance.",2018/09/21,guy60,london

"Don’t get me wrong, the buildings, temples and general sacred nature of this place are beautiful. There’s clearly a lot of history and interesting background to the architecture and relics. HOWEVER, it’s not cheap (1500 rupees), and we received absolutely no information/no map/no audio guide. The only way to receive further info was to pay an extra 1000 for a tour guide, which we didn’t, being on a budget, as many travellers will be. For the #1 rated thing to do in Kandy, we were disappointed. Tourists and visitors should absolutely visit sacred temples whilst in Sri Lanka but we’d like to be educated about what we’re visiting and their significance too! There are lots of other temples in Kandy to see which are free as they are purely religious sites, with no tourist pull. At these temples, we felt absolutely fine about receiving no info - just the price felt an injustice!",2018/09/21,Georgia R,
"It’s a kings palace later converted in to a temple by keeping lord Buddha’s one of the teeth It’s one of the most respected and holy places for Buddhist but visited and worshipped by millions of ppl around the world Go with proper clothes. White is better Girls dress to cover your shoulders and up to kneesGuys no shots If you go around 11.45 am and 6.00 pm you should be able to see the daily drumming ceremony and could go closer to the tooth relic casketJuly is the month it has the “perahera” which is a parade with over 50 elephants with nicely dressed , 1000s of traditional dancers and drum beaters One of the most colorful and beautiful pageants in the worldAdd this in your must go listMany more to see in this spectacular place",2018/09/21,Matzferd-HK,"Hong Kong, China"
Well worth a visit - beautiful architecture and sacred artefacts to see. There is also a small museum which contains artefacts from archaeological digs in the area. Just be aware that the tooth itself can only be seen at certain times of the year - related to full moon days and specific religious ceremonies. Tickets for this are scarce and need to be bought well in advance. It’s also probably best to avoid Pooja times as it gets very busy inside.,2018/09/21,sammywarna,"Yorkshire, United Kingdom"
Visited here as part of any organised group. Very enjoyable but somehow missed the actual sacred tooth relic. (Think I was looking for the wrong thing!) loved the stories about Rajiv the elephant. Just be aware of all the religious sites we have visited in Sri Lanka this was the strictest in terms of dress coded. Members of our group were made to put on jumpers rather than just using scarfs and we saw other tourists being turned away.,2018/09/21,EMELeicestershire,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom"
"Attended in the late afternoon and the tempe was still busy especially inside where many of the locals/buddhists were meditating.The history of the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic (& the Buddha's tooth) is very special and sacred for many of the Buddhist faith. Unfortunately we weren't there at the scheduled time to view the actual tooth (I think twice a day) & missed the annual August procession of the tooth around Kandy on the back of an elephant. The buildings of the temple complex are very nice, beautiful landscaping and seeing some of the old books in the library were amazing.Great to see the locals sharing their faith and peacefulness amongst the business and noise of Kandy even if the crowds are a bit 'close'.",2018/09/21,188petere,"Brisbane, Australia"
"It is a beautiful Buddhist temple and a ""must see"" if you are visiting Kandy but it became very crowded during our visit. We arrived at 9.30am and joined the queues to glimpse inside the room containing the golden casket (which houses the tooth of the Buddha.) As well as the main temple there are other smaller temples and museums within the complex. Altogether an interesting visit.On a practical note, knees and shoulders must be covered and shoes removed before entering the temple (Socks are useful.) They can be stored in a kiosk for a few rupees.",2018/09/21,P2550WSninac,
"Ella is definitely my favorite destination in Sri Lanka. This lovely little town surrounded by lush green countryside attracts many visitors every year. From most epic hikes, railways, waterfalls, spectacular bridges to famous tea plantations. This is a place to stay longer, to explore more, because Ella is like no other city in Sri Lanka. It is also the best place in Sri Lanka, where you can completely disconnect and refresh your brain. I recommend to book your hotel up in the hill instead of staying on the main road in the city. Nothing can beats the incredible view of the lush hills and tea plantations in the morning",2018/09/21,adventurecatcher,

It is always a best way to start your journey or tour of a country by paying a visit to the national museum. This kind of place gives a tourist enough information about history of the country. This museum was actually set up by the British in late 19th century. It has very rich and interesting collection of exhibits from Sri Lanka’s royal past. There are archeological items too. The library of this museum also has valuable ancient texts of different languages. A must visit place if you are in Colombo.

Along with several remains of places and other royal structures there are number of Buddhist relics and statues too.

This is a UNESCO world heritage site of Sri Lanka.",2018/09/21,SANKHA BHATTACHARYA,
An amazing historic site in Sri Lanka that is declared as world heriatge by UNESCO. Tourists can visit the place and see remains of an ancient fort that was built on the top of a piece of rock near the city of Dambulla. The ruins can be dated back to 5th century AD. The interesting thing is that you have to ascend some steps to reach the top of the rock. At the base of the steps there are broken parts of a statue on either side that resembles a giant lion.,2018/09/21,SANKHA BHATTACHARYA,
Another UNESCO world heritage site in Sri Lanka that can be visited while you are visiting the town of Dambulla. The caves here are almost two thousand years old.

Also try go early morning we were there at 6.30am so took the climb at our own pace, the heat was not to much and thorougly enjoyed it. The ruins at the top are full of history and the view is spectacular. If the going gets tough the local people who work then will give you a hand climbing with a broad smile and encouragement. I do not particularly like heights but the view is worth the climb",2018/09/20,carmorris101,"Dublin, Ireland"

The walk and climb is up a sheer rock face and will take a couple of hours but when you get to the top wow. You have an amazing structure built on top of a rock, how this was achieved one can only imagine. The best thing is the views 360 degrees of the country for miles. I was so pleased that we made the climb to feel a level of achievement but also to witness one of the many wonders of this country.

There was some interesting encounters with eagles, monkeys and others but the highlight came on the main road leading to one of the entrances to the park when two elephants were casually strolling along and we got inches close to them as they are inquisitive beasts.

"Bit disappointed by our visit here today. We had a lovely walk through the jungle and the view point over the city is lovely a peaceful (in my opinion even better than 'the' Kandy view point) however we saw very few wildlife. We had to really scour our surroundings as we walked to see three dear in the distance. Didn't see any birds or boar, despite looking around for ages. Not sure if it was the time of year, the fact it has rained, the time of day..m but we were walking around for just over two hours, really looking and being quiet and saw very little. Entry price was reasonable though and the history behind the reserve is interesting. So I don't regret going, just bit disappointed. Don't expect too much! You had to walk up a bit of a hill to get to the entrance but after that, not too hilly.",2018/09/20,Lucyyyyyy,"London, United Kingdom"
We visited about 10am and while it wasn’t packed we had to queue slowly to move around. An interesting place.

So the day that we went there it was pretty darn crowded and we hope we went there another day and then we were wondering why did that happen and it was because that day was a public holiday so I strictly recommend you not to go there on public holidays specially in April and August also in December because those months students get vacations so they go on trips. So I think it’s better to go near sigiriya and talk with some locals from maybe the hotels and get to know a best day.,2018/09/19,aruna_subodha,"Galle, Sri Lanka"

The climb is quite heart pumping and also if you suffer from vertigo at some points you may struggle but the view is stunning and well worth it. On the way back down you could see the crowds starting to build up so we were glad we avoided them especially the Chinese who tend to talk very loud and this is apparently what gets the wasps going( hope this isn’t classed as racist) of which we didn’t see any Mark and Anne",2018/09/18,triggzey,"Warboys, United Kingdom"

The TOOTH TEMPLE is beautiful Buddhist temple in Kandy Sri Lanka and attached to it is a Museum which has the different Buddhist idols from different countries where Buddhism is practiced. My only contention is the entry fees LKR 1500/- for for foreigners and LKR1000/- tourists from SAARC countries. I really felt that the entry fees is too much. A trip to the temple cost us a family of 4 LKR 5000/- which included the guide (lkr1000) . It is a place of worship and felt the high entry charges are making the place a business.

"Worth going to for a visit but beware of people in the street telling you about a special one day only festival haaaapening today. The scam is that they wave down a tuktuk to take you who then charges an exorbitant price ie 8000 rupee for a trip worth at most 300. Negotiate your price before getting in! They will also tell you to visit a gem factory that has a special sale on due to the festival, this is also a scam. Don't buy unless you are an expert and really know the value of gems.",2018/09/18,bellini11,"Auckland, New Zealand"

"This iconic museum is easy to locate on all the maps and the taxis and Tuk tuks know how to get round the back where the entrance way is, somewhat against intuition. It's a big museum, and we only managed the ground floor in just over an hour, as the first floor gets closed off at 4pm - although it was already shut when we got there at 3.30. Having said that there was plenty to keep us occupied, with a thorough grounding in Sri Lanka's pre history and the development of its people's and culture. There was sadly very little about the indigenous forest/aboriginal people's. Masses of info about the various kingdoms and their development and it helped put some of our visits to Polonaruwa and Anadrahapura in context. Masses of stone and statue archeology and the most curious exhibit was a slab of stone which had been the base for an urinal/toilet at one of the Buddhist monasteries about 2,000 years ago. Quite a few local families were enjoying themselves on this late Saturday afternoon. The Lanka tourist shop is next door too!",2018/09/17,suesalford,"Salford, United Kingdom"

It was refreshing to visit a true living temple where worshippers gather in droves to offer lotus flowers and pray to the sacred tooth relic.

Not cheap mind you but worth it, the walk up includes many ancient ruins and drawings. The view is amazing. Oh...watch out for bees!",2018/09/16,tav27,"Colchester, United Kingdom"
"The ticket office opens at 0700, therefore you can’t do sunrise on this rock. The tickets cost $35USD per person for tourists. (for some reason, you’ll come across lots of prices being quoted in USD and I can’t remember what I paid in LKR :/). I would recommend walking at around opening time as there are less people walking at this time and it’s not overly sunny. We also found that lots of people were arriving as we were finishing up. As you enter, there’s lovely water gardens and a moat. The walk is sealed and only steps. No uneven ground or loose gravel however there is quite a number of stairs and can be steep at times. Some of the stairs are awkward if you have a longer foot, so be careful of that. Once you get to the top, there’s plenty of space to cover including the original royal pool. There’s a lot of history here. Theres a museum near the ticket office which is a nice stop off at the end before leaving. We had our guide Sangeeth Gayan who told us the story of the old fortress and the history associated with Lion Rock.",2018/09/16,Micra8687,"Tweed Heads, Australia"
"We were a bit taken aback at the 30 dollars entrance fee but the site is well work a visit. But go early both to avoid the crowds and the worst of the heat. It opens at 7 am so be there at that time. We stayed on a nearby guesthouse and walked over. The wall paintings are beautiful and one of the attendents pointed out the mistakes to us -3 hands, 3 nipples. The climb is reasonably strenuous but if you go early, you will have some shade. The views on top are magnificent and although there is no shade apart from a couple of trees, there was a strong cooling breeze. All in all, stunning!",2018/09/16,marinoonan,"Waterford, Ireland"

We visited Yala National Park in August 2018. I had read it was quite commercialised but went ahead with the booking. We chose the sunrise safari and on arrival there were 75+ jeeps waiting to enter the Park!! The drivers all call/ text each other so when an animal is spotted loads of jeeps flock to this one spot. If you are one of the last there you of course can't see a thing. We got very unlucky and saw very little widlife- we didn't even see an elephant let alone a leopard. It is luck of the draw but if returning I would not go back to Yala. My friend recommended Udawalawe National Park as you are guaranteed to see elephants and it is not packed with jeeps.,2018/09/16,Exploration811767,Ireland

"Reaching the entrance of the park is an experience of it's own. Had to get there by a 4X4 provided by the owner of Sinharaja Eco lodge. We booked a tour thru him and he provided a very fantastic guide Hemal who speaks good English & had a very observant while walking to show us the many kinds of indigenous Lizards,Spiders and snakes, butterflies, the century old trees etc which can be found only in Sinharaja which is very unique as Sri Lanka being such a small island it cannot be found in the rest of the world. The many waterfalls you come across are wonderful and you can have a dip in it.Don't forget to take Leach socks during the rainy season this is a must and having a refreshing bath at the waterfalls. Please be careful not to litter the place and take plenty of water and some snacks if you are doing the full day trek. A must do trip for environment lovers and a wonderful thing to show the kids as to why we need to take care of our surroundings.The best thing here there is no cellphone signals which makes the environment more peaceful while trekking with no phones ringing around you and not disturbing nature.",2018/09/12,M-one98,Riyadh

There are a lot of souvenir & Gems shops and restaurants inside the fort, but due to it being a tourist hub, they will fleece you. There are 2 museums, some churches and a few government offices & Banks, inside this huge area. The entrance to the fort is also very impressive. The Galle cricket stadium is right next to the fort and from the ramparts of the fort, you can have a clear view of the entire stadium.

Lovely grounds too, and an abundance of wildlife. Super easy to get the bus to and from if you're on a budget! Also worth walking through the wildlife belt past all the local stands to see the giant Buddha (just follow the locals instead of going to the tourist car park). No need for a guide either. The walk to Aligaya caves (signposted down from the steps to climb sigiriya) was a bit sketchy, we didn't make it all the way so probably best not to try!!",2018/09/11,tamsypie,"London, United Kingdom"

This is less intense than climbing Ella Rock. But the views are as stunning. In fact you get a front on view of Ella Rock itself. It’s about 1.5hrs one-way. It’s best that you time your climb to catch the sunset. Alternatively start early so that you escaped the heat of the sun.

When i turned into a photographer i used to roam here with my camera to take sunset scenes as well as to capture fishing boats going into the sea at dusk filling with golden sunlight behind boats. This is one of the safest beaches where you can walk even during middle of the night. If you are going for a sea swim make sure to bath where the flags are planted.

The local people seem to truly value and care for this UNESCO World Heritage Site which is nice to see also. There are a LOT of steps and climbing so if you’re out of shape maybe think twice. Many of the pathways and stair climbs are narrow and it’s annoying when bottlenecks form behind people not really fit enough to make the climb- in September it’s really, really hot too!

"Sigiriya Rock and gardens is really a lovely place, there is a moat like canal as you enter, then the water gardens that some still hold water but most and the rest of the site are just small remnants of what you could imagine to be an impressive place.Be warned of unofficial guides and hawkers, they will offer to guide you around but we heard of people being told to pay exorbitant amounts, these are not official guides and are not linked to the site.You walk just a short way from the ticket entrance and you see Lions Rock in all its beauty, and of course the metal stairways you have to climb to get to the summit.It starts sedately but then the real climb begins, first tier lands at a balcony then a spiral staircase that leads to a cave with murals then descend another spiral staircase to carry on up the rock. After another tier of steps you land on a forecourt where you can just see the last pieces of the lions feet and the stairway between them. From here it’s a final slog to the top, look to your left near the top and you will see the Hornet Nests black looking and rather ominous.On the summit it opens up onto different terraces of foundation walls like in the water gardens and a pool half filled at one end.The views are fantastic and you can see the water gardens and entrance where you just passed through.",2018/09/09,lancashirescott,"Lancashire, United Kingdom"

"The fort is absolutely beautiful and a really nice walk around if you do the whole fort. There's plenty to see, the only thing I would say is there are a lot of people selling things, but they are not too intrusive or insistent. The restaurants in the Galle Fort area are lovely too. But I have to mention our lovely tuk tuk driver Suresh, who took us to the Galle Fort and back to our hotel in Koggala was lovely. Just to mention, he helped us for our trip giving us the best deals and knowing the best people to get local prices, which we then went away to research before we agreed to. He did a trip for the Kottawa Rainforest that I would recommend seeing as well, very interest, loads of monkeys and lizards! If you do go around the Koggala area, look up Suresh! He took us to a really lovely restaurant at Galle Fort, where we had a mix of curries that were made by the mother of the restaurant owner, absolutely delicious. It's only a small place so get him to take you, and it's beautifully decorated but super busy! (Also really great value for money!)",2018/09/09,Stephanie M,

Cars, gold, furniture, and a lock of Buddha's hair.There are also some very precious rubys in a locked display room. Our local tuk tuk driver asked the deputy head monk if we could go inside, and he surprisingly agreed, and also did a blessing using the 4kg slab of gold to perform the ritual - all genuine (as opposed to some of those that are dressed as monks at some tourist sites)There were many locals visiting the temple which was encouraging.Very cheap to enter, and well worth it - especially if you can get a local to show you around.",2018/09/08,Richard T,"Burnley, United Kingdom"

Yes, it takes some effort to get up there and the spiral staircase to view the frescos is not for the faint-hearted if you have a fear of heights....but watch your feet and persevere and you will be rewarded and then some. There were some really old people doing it when we went and they seemed to manage.Didn't have any hornet/wasp problems when we were there but they have a sort of shelter at the lions paws in case of attack which I thought was reassuring.We got there at around 8.00 and took some quieter routes up (recommended by our guide Siri - excellent) and down which maybe saved us a bit of time.This was one of my Sri Lankan highlights. If you like history, don't mind sweating a bit, love amazing views and can have some vision as to the way things used to be - definitely do it.P.S. the monkeys obviously make a mockery of us by climbing up these structures so easily and perching precariously on rock ledges whilst eating the remnants of rubbish left by tourists....don't drop litter or try and pet them and I am guessing they will only add to the ambience!",2018/09/06,Paul B,"Wakefield, United Kingdom"

"It's the only national park all over Sri Lanka you can walk through. We prayed 7000LKR for two people (tuk tuk to get there included). If you wanna see a lot of animals, you might go for other places but to do some hiking, this is definitely the place to stay. We did both climbing Kirigalpotta and went through the round trip to world's end and baker's falls in one day. Kirigalpotta took us 5.5 hours and the round trip should be doable within 2.5 hours. On the way to the Kirigalpotta summit, you need to walk through some fields and jungle forests but if you at least got little experience in hiking, it is easy to find the trekking path. Not that much people around this way. It is not straightforward to get there but we recommend to check it out since it's worth it. We stayed at Nuwara Eliya and took the first bus to Pattipola at 6.30am. From there, we catched a tuk tuk which is about 2000-2500LKR back and forth. The last bus from Pattipola to Nuwara Eliya is around 5.30pm. Of course, it is much easier to get there if you have a driver but we recommend to visit this place in any case.",2018/09/04,Andy L,

"We initially wanted to go to Adam's Peak but that was closed for 3 months, so we decided to do Sigiriya instead. Luckily, we paid local prices. It's still worth it, even at tourist prices as the upkeep of the place must cost quite a bit. Pros: * You don't need to be fit. *You still feel like you've achieved something after climbing to the top* Great views - you can see Buddha statue, the other rock (Pidurangala). *Great for photos* Great place for souvenir shopping/ refreshments at the bottom. There's even a snake charmer Cons: *Very crowded, even if you start early* Can be bit scary for those afraid of heights* It's hot when you're climbing but there is a nice breeze at the top. * Forget about seeing the sunrise* If you climb right to the top, you'll see those little wells. Another stairway sort of thing leads to the ""security toilet"". (The toilet used by the security guards who are stuck at the top all day) The pee just drips down the rockface and I know exactly where the water from there is draining (you'll smell it after the walk is finished and you head to the tourist carpark). One of the guides actually had the nerve to stop the tourists there and goes ""This is where the natural rainwater drains."" yeah.....Tips* Wear good shoes (I preferred walking barefoot because my shoes were not that great)*Take lots of water & a hat, wear sunscreen if you need to. (I didn't)* There are clean toilets at the bottom. Pee before the climb.* If you have time, have a look around the gardens which are beautiful. I heard the museum was informative as well, but we didn't go there. If you're a foreigner and don't want to pay US$45, there are 2 options: you can take a tuk tuk and drive around the area: beautiful gardens and lake. Or you can climb Pidurangala rock: an equally amazing climb.",2018/09/03,hottamilnyc,nyc

You can take photos inside the premises and the ticket price for a local was very cheap.It included Sri Lankan history and my daughter was amused to see lot of the things she learnt at school in the museum. Cannot highly recommend the lav-oratory facilities. But you can go to Barista in the same compound to have a coffee and a snack and use their rest rooms which is better.

"The actual Temple is located in a vast complex consisting of the former palace of the local King. The temple is situated in the middle of this complex. There are separate queues for foreigners and for locals and so also the entry fee, which for foreigners is quite steep. The temple observes strict worship timing and if you don't be there when it is open for public view, then you are bundled out and the doors closed. The whole complex is so vast that walking around makes you tired. During the time of the Kandy Perahera, the rush is huge at this temple and every night at 7 PM a procession of dancers and other local exhibits are taken out. To watch this people line up every vantage point of the route of this procession from 1 PM in the afternoon.

To think there is a sacred tooth from Buddha himself is quite amazing.Sadly you can't see the tooth, or even the case the tooth is kept inside (as it's all kept behind a large golden door), but it's lovely to see local people pray and it is amazing to even be this close to something so special.Overall:Worth a visit and it truly is amazing to be so close to something like this.

"This is not a conventional temple I'd say.A Buddhist temple which is nicely kept, however it's full of quite random artifacts and collections which just felt a bit odd in a beautiful temple environment.The statues are beautiful and walking around the main courtyard feels nice and peaceful.However walking into the various rooms filled to the rim with random objects from around the world, ornaments and even an area with random cars, just felt wrong. I appreciate it's more of a museum come temple, but for me the idea of filling a temple with so many products of material value felt a little contradictory to the idea of Buddhist living.As usual this temple runs a service to look after tourist shoes which is good, but at an entrance fee. Off memory I think it was 600 rupees per person which again feels just a little excessive, but then again I guess this is very much a tourist price vs potentially fee entry for locals.It is a lovely place to visit, but I would recommend they remove all the countless objects everywhere and focus on more of the temple element and calming nature of this location.Many better temples to visit in Sri Lanka but if you don't have a chance to visit places outside of Colombo then it would still be somewhere to check out.",2018/09/01,892ketanb,"Aylesbury, United Kingdom"
Took a tuk tuk to this temple. If you only see one temple in Colombo make it this one. It will cost 600 rupees but keep your ticket as it will get you into other temples for no further costs.

If you take a guide obviously they will explain everything about this ancient temple but you can easily self guide here.,2018/09/01,Basil781,"Tasmania, Australia"
"Well worth a visit. The museum is interesting as has English commentaries. The view from the top of the rock is beautiful. It was great to hear about the history of the rock from our guide / driver. The climb to the top is not for the faint hearted, on winding and sometimes open stairs attached into the cliff edge. I have only given four stars because the ques to get up were terrible. There was roughly 2 hours of queuing to ascend the rock.",2018/08/31,cwatkinson,"Preston, United Kingdom"
"The entrance price for foreigners is a lot more than the local people. Take water , start the climb as early as possible otherwise it gets very hot in the midday sun. Recommend you wear trainers it is very steep in some parts. Beautiful paintings inside a cave at the top of the spiral staircase, you don't get enough time to see the paintings as you are ushered on by the guard who sits there. There is a half way point , lions paw but no toilets . You reach the top by a so called staircase , the views are amazing at the top. I thought I could not get to the top but I saw locals who very elderly and mothers with babies climbing. It took us two hours to reach the top , we spent about half an hour at the top. Make sure you rest plenty before you start your downward journey my legs felt like jelly because I hadn't rested enough . The day we went it was totally packed with people pushing and shoving. There is a nice museum at the entrance.",2018/08/31,kirti j,"London, United Kingdom"
"Well worth the climb and the early start. We went up to the top first to avoid heat and crowds, and visited the other things like caves and points of interest afterwards (you can access them even once you are directed on the way down to the 'foreigners' car park'). It's actually a smaller area at the top than I expected. I am 54 and of average fitness and I didn't struggle with the steps. Just pace yourself (slow-moving crowd anyway) and take plenty of water. Lots of monkeys added interest for us. We had to wave away someone trying to act as a guide but he gave up pretty easily. Didn't really resent the high $30 fee but I do wish they would do even more to pick up rubbish. It was ok at the top but fairly bad in lower areas before the climb. Didn't feel entirely safe on the staircases - I do wonder how often the structure is properly checked and whether there is ever any limit on the number of people going up and down at any one time. Maybe that's just me! I certainly wouldn't take children younger than 8.",2018/08/31,CarolineM634,"Le Mont Felard, United Kingdom"

Quite a climb to the top but our young 3-year-old daughter managed to make it to all but the last few steps before needing to be carried as she was so excited about all the interesting things on the way It probably not for those afraid of heights as the walkway is steep and narrow in parts. If you are physically challenged it may be worth paying one of the guides to pull you up or carry your child note that they are very expensive and most of there tour is just written on the self guide signs on the way up. Take plenty of water as it can be quite hot. I would not miss this site if you are in the area.,2018/08/31,Alcheringasailing,"Bowen, Australia"

Was in Yala National Park late August. We were recommended to go here by many locals and guides (obviously). But if you are heading here with a hope of seeing Elephants or Leopards I would definitely recommend to head elsewhere.We saw two elephants here from a large distance and ditto for the leopards.Later we were told that there are only a handful of both animals here.Better off seeing either Minneriya or Udawalawe where the tours aren’t as dragged out or as empty.,2018/08/31,Creevey92,"County Dublin, Ireland"

"We visited Ella in August and found it to be one of the most scenic places ever. We walked from our accommodation to Little Adam's Peak using just the printed town map dished out by the Tourist stand. It is very straightforward and well signposted from the main road. The walk takes in stunning views at every angle, and shows off Sri Lanka at her most beautiful best. There was also a snake charmer sat around one corner, but we didn't stop for the show. We walked up in trainers, but locals were ascending and descending in flip flops, so it's not a difficult walk - would note that we did it in dry weather - but do take water as it can be a hot one.",2018/08/31,Jo C,"Leeds, United Kingdom"
"Two friends, my wife, little son and I climbed Little Adam's Peak in August. The hike is not very challenging (I was carrying our son and my wife our backpack), but totally worth the effort. After reaching the top, the view across Ella and the surrounding area (e.g. Ella Rock) is brilliant and somehow it's not too crowded (there are also multiple different view points) so that you can definitely enjoy the atmosphere. Furthermore we don't think that a guide is necessary for the hike. We did it on our own using free navigation apps.From our perspective Little Adam's Peak is definitely a must see and we'll come back for sure on our next trip to Ella.",2018/08/31,Chris318i,"Regensburg, Germany"

There are so many interesting and unusual artworks and artefacts on display to see in rooms that are carefully curated, much like a museum.

It goes against the very beliefs of Buddha.My son was very distressed.",2018/08/31,taniabee31,"Adelaide, Australia"

I visited Little Adam's Peak with my husband in August 2018. We very much enjoyed the first part of the walk which was a gentle upward stroll through the plantations; the second part is harder in that it is steeper although there are stairs climbing up the peak which is very helpful and you can stop and rest along the way. It took us approx. 45 minutes to get up and 30 - 35 mins to get down. The view is beautiful and there is enough room for everyone to find a quiet spot and take some pictures. We spent about 30 minutes at the top before heading back down.,2018/08/30,GemmaLFR,"Singapore, Singapore"

On our way to tea countries Nuwara Elliya, we stopped in Kandy to pay a visit to this wonderful place. We ran into a nice young entrepreneur person who speaks Japanese and he's told us about the business he does between Japan and Sri Lanka. He even gave us his contact information and kindly invited us to contact him next time we come back for a visit in Colombo. The sacred place gave us a good luck running into a nice group of people.",2018/08/30,teddybear1216,"Hong Kong, China"

"Most visitors that are disappointed with Yala have unrealistic expectations about the animal density. Yala is a beautiful natural park; one of the few safaris spots with a beach and an ocean in the horizon. It has a great diversity of animals. However, the area covered by tours is small (140 sq Km, for those with rusty math, this is approx a square with sides of 12 Km) and the number of big animals is not large. So, guides often are paying attention to their phones, rushing to reach a particular spot where somebody has spotted one of the few leopards in the park. A great advantage of Yala is that it is much more affordable than African safaris. So, overall, the value is not bad.",2018/08/29,Diego C,"Newton, Massachusetts"

"Although we didn't know it, our visit coincided with both a Sunday and a Poya day, which meant that the site was absolutely packed and the climb to the top was via a continuous caterpillar of people!We came with our guide of 10 days into our tour of Sri Lanka and he was fabulous in helping us to make it to the top, when we didn't think we would make it. Retired and with various walking problems we both thought we would be lucky to get to the Lions Paw platform - but the view from the top is amazing and the short diversion up and down the circular stairs to see the Sigiriya maidens was delightful, although there wasn't many of them left.The mirror wall didn't really show itself at its best, I could understand how this was supposed to work, but it apparently reflected the light beautifully!As someone with no head for heights, the cos tang stream of people was a blessing because I couldn't always see the drop but I was sad to see the litter left by people at the Lions Paw not helped by monkeys getting hold of stuff from visitors. A member of staff was trying to hold back the tide!At the top, the view really is breathtaking and it is much bigger than you expect it to be, and the set out of the water gardens below is stunning. How clever were they, all those years ago. An audacious idea turned onto reality, this is a superb place to defend, but how on earth did they build it and then occupy it?The steps are steep, the last section of iron and steel set into the rock wall, scary for me, but worth every ounce of energy. By the way, doing it in the heat of the mid day sun is not a great idea!We took a slow and careful 3 hours plus time in the museum and site beforehand.",2018/08/28,suesalford,"Salford, United Kingdom"
"Our family experience was terrible to put nicely. The staff and security were highly discriminitive forcing foreigners to pay a higher price than locals to climb a rock unsafely without any toilet facilities or first aid. My family and I faced prejudice to buy a foreign ticket despite us being locals and showing our identity cards as proof; eventhough we politely addressed them, they disgustingly degraded our nationality just to earn more money. We had heard stories from others about this bigotry behaviour as it has been on the local news as well as other families sharing our experience; but now experiencing this firsthand, we do not encourage you to go here.It was a waste of our moeny in the end as the climing eperience was packed and uncomfortable with little regards to safety; plus there was a risk of hornets and wasps nearby that could attack.",2018/08/28,Sam D,"Bridlington, United Kingdom"
"Top tip: Get a great guide to tell you the stories and show you the way up and the best way down! Ask at your hotel and they will organise for a guide before you get there and your guide will meet you. We had 'Neil' - I'm sure he had a much nicer Sri Lankan name than that though!If you are visiting Sri Lanka this is a must do if you are physically able. It is a steep climb and a little nerve-wracking which makes it all the more special when you reach the top. Take plenty of water (personally, I drank 3 litres with a hyralite in each 1.5-litre bottle - which most of us did). Wear a hat and sunscreen as there (obviously) is no shade at all. Naturally, there are only toilets at ground level. If you are not physically able to do the climb it is still such an amazing view from the bottom and still worth visiting.

The jeeps are much higher and noisier than the ones they used in Africa. But unlike Africa the drivers drove on large rocks and deep sand, that was a fun experience in itself.We went in the late afternoon for 3 hours, it was a very hot day. Not many animals to be seen, a sole elephant, water buffaloes, storks, wild pigs, deers, crocs, monkeys and mongoose. In the last 30mins we were lucky enough to stumble on a leopard.

We also saw lots of leopards including one which incredibly walked right up to the car and along the road in front of us.Plenty of water buffalo, peacock, mongoose and crocodiles.Some stunning plant life, rock formations and watering holes where the animals collect.Amazing anf remember place for the wild safari.",2018/08/28,naveenr532,Raa Atoll

"A relatively easy walk for the reasonably fit, which took about 25 minutes from the bust stop on the road at the bottom. Wearing sandals is fine along the well-trodden path. The views at the top are very worth while; these and the small Buddhist shrine (and the inevitable dog) at the top make this one of the very 'Sri Lankan' things to do during a trip to Ella. It was pleasing to see the frequent signs urging everyone to avoid littering and particularly not to leave anything plastic in the vicinity.

"Very interesting place with a lot of history and a great view. You have to count of beeing here around 2,3-3,5 hours and the sun is shining stongly on the mountain so bring a lot of water and sunglasses It is quite windy on the mountain so do not ware skirt, dress, or hats. (As this is not a temple you do not need to cover the knees, so ware shorts and t-shirt, or sport cloths as you will be sweaty).Do not forget to visit the museum directly when you have purchased your ticket, the exit is at the other side of the mountain so you will not return to the entrance where the museum is situatid if you haf planned to finish with this activity.Start your day early at the site as it is both very hot and very crowded at the site. We started our climb at 8.15 in the morning but there was so many people there so we qued all the way up to the top (which on the positive side made the climb of the stair easy as you only took tree steps at a time and then rested :-) )Be aware of the monkeys, they seemed to be a bit nosy to people resting by the lion paws.",2018/08/26,994thereset,"Stockholm, Sweden"
The citadel is worth the wait. There is a long line due to the lack of infrastructure going up to the frescoes cave. I'd advise visitors to wake up early and try to be in line before 9 am.

"Sigiriya rock. This was the first place i visited on reaching Sri Lanka. It has an amazing history, do take a guide to give you the detailed history of the area. The climb to the peak is comfortable with over 2500 steps, so wear comfortable footwear and carry water bottles. There are amazing view points on the way, great spots to take pictures. Dont miss the elephant, cobra and lion gates facing 3 different sides and the paintings inside. Kids and senior citizens might get tired of climbing though. Washrooms are only available near the ticket counter. Tickets for SAARC nations are more economical than for other countries, and some guides could take advantage of our ignorance and quote higher prices.",2018/08/26,Sandhya I,
"Entrance is $30USD per person— that means for my boyfriend and I, we paid $60USD to climb stairs to the top of a giant old rock.That’s pretty much what we paid for three nights accommodations in Kandy.The local price for this attraction is closer to $1.50USD. I’m all for charging foreign tourists a bit extra, but not 15x-20x more. In a country where the cost of living is low, $30USD is unjust pricing, designed to gouge tourists of our dollars.As for the experience itself, even though we began our hike fairly early at 9am it was absolutely packed with tourists, there’s literally a slow moving lineup the entire way up the rock. Then you have the people (always locals never foreign tourists) who push past or try to get in front of you which is very annoying.The view at the top was nice, green, and beautiful — but you could get that same gorgeous Sri Lanken landscape on the side of a highway. This is the sole reason why I’ve given my review two stars — for the view and nothing else.If I could redo my day, I would do the smaller Pidurangala rock instead which has a view of Sigiriya and, from what I’ve read on TripAdvisor, much more affordable.",2018/08/26,modernmixtravel,"Vancouver, Canada"
"Had been looking forward to this as the highlight of my trip to Sri Lanka. Unfortunately, the site was so overcrowded that we were unable to climb up the rock - the early parts of the climb up stone steps are unfenced and there was plenty of jostling and some arguments. Just waiting for an accident to happen - saw a few close shaves.The whole experience was so unpleasant that we bailed early - had become a box-ticking exercise, with no pelasure involved.I can only assume that the authorities only care about the income over visitor satisfaction ($75 for two adults and two kids). Does a dis-service to Sri Lankan tourism - sort it out!The focus on just the rock is also a shame - the gardens around the rock are rather lovely. A final aside - the tourist car park is non-sensically placed at the bottom of the rock, so if you go to the museum after visiting the rock, you then have to persaude the authorities to let you back into the park to be able to leave.",2018/08/26,Angus D,"Beeston, United Kingdom"
"We had read a few scare stories before coming and were pleased to say it was not a terrifying as people made out. There are a lot of steps, but the place is slow and there are a lot of stops so it was fine. There were wasps but we went early and stayed quiet (the best advice) so they didn’t actually bother us. It is high, but the steps feel safe and you just don’t look down. There were a few dogs too, but all asleep. We definitely felt a sense of achievement when we got to the top and could relax and enjoy the views and ruins. The Museum, which we visited afterwards, was also informative. The best advice I think is to go early- we were there 7.30 and when we were leaving the crowds were pouring in.",2018/08/26,sharieramanella,Twickenham
To get the most out of the visit you need a guide to explain what you are seeing and the history. They also point out details you would miss. It is also worth noting that there are several bee nests near the final staircase which if disturbed will prevent you climbing the final staircase to the top of the rock.My guide told me there are over 1200 steps to get to the top but once there the views are amazing. Part way up the climb there are 2 circular staircases that give access to the rock paintings.My wife has a problem with heights and was unable to see the paintings or the Lion gate as there are a lot of steps to be covered before you get to either of these 2 areas. We left our hotel before breakfast (06:45) and it was not too crowded on the way up. We were back at our hotel after 2 hours so in plenty of time for late breakfast.,2018/08/26,TonyM719,"Cornwall, England"
"This trek was included in our tour, our driver insisted we get in the car by 5am to start our walk by 6am so we don’t get stuck in the hectic traffic jam and the views would be clear from the mist. Let me tell you the drive to here and back to our hotel scared me, I’ve been driven in lots of countries and have desensitised myself to the crazy driving but this time I almost wet my pants. Picture narrow roads on a high cliff with bus, cars trying to push each other off, well that’s how it felt like. Now we could of skipped this tour but the fear of missing out got the better of us. First tip is it’s cold, not freezing so I would suggest a jumper you can take off later when it warms up. The tour took us 3hrs 15mins, we are unfit and took numerous of breaks. So for us It’s not an easy trek as others say it was but is definitely it’s doable. There were parts of climbing up rocks that felt like forever!Wear comfortable shoes, there were very slippery muddy areas, and I fell over twice but I’m clumsy. There were lots of rocks that were waiting to trip us over. Oh and do not take any plastic bags in the Park, they are not allowed in.The sights are nice, some very beautiful areas. A few waterfalls to see, I was disappointed we didn’t see any wildlife.At the end of the day I am proud we finished it but would we do it again? Hell no!!!",2018/08/26,DirtyDewang,

"You will probably see animals at the National Park. You will also be terrified by the wide driving of your safari guide.There are too many vehicles all rushing and racing each other to get the best view of the animals. If an animal is found, jeeps come from everywhere and surround the poor creature until if runs off in fright. I felt quite sorry for the animals as there is nothing discrete and quiet about the way these tours are operated. All the animals are acutely aware of you and the chaos that these jostling vehicles create.Having said that, and having survived the often wild and dangerous driving as our guide tried to be first to everything, we did see some animals. We saw crocodiles, elephants, some mongoose, and eagles. We were lucky enough to watch some crocodiles ripping apart a deer they'd killed the day before.I am glad I had the experience of Yala, but if the National Parks don't start to regulate the number of vehicle, the behaviour of the drivers and give the animals some respite, I fear the Park is doomed.",2018/08/25,Jennifer L,"Sydney, Australia"

The temple was very crowded and you needed to be careful of not stepping on people praying on the floor.

"If you’re very interested in the history of this place than go up, but I would not recommend it at all. Without stress and waiting less than 1,5hours (expect the Sri Lankan way of queueing with much body contact and queue jumping) it’s just possible in the early morning or late afternoon and the hardest thing is, that you (tourist) pay 4830R (30USD) and the locals pay 50R (0,30USD).I totally see the point that we tourists should pay more, because of low income and the poor people here, but the difference between these two entrance fees is way to big, that’s just insane and everybody is paying that, for a place which is not worth it.A shame on this place and these prices!Not worth for what you get there.I would rather go to the Pidurangala, which is close (10min walk from main point/ticket office)Better view on the lion rock, less people and the price is reasonable (500R)I would defiantly not go up to the lion rock again.",2018/08/24,Max S,

I think everyone of a basic fitness level should have a go at climbing but if you have strong vertigo, maybe just stay on the first level.Don't miss the museum...it's basic but interesting.",2018/08/24,imaginelle,"Sydney, Australia"

"Simply a must - yes it’s a lot of steps, but make sure you start as close to 7am as you can to beat the heat and crowds, then you can stop and rest as many times as you need on the way up and down. All up we spent about 80mins in total from bottom to top and down again including at least 25-30mins at the top enjoying the view and different parts of the ruins. By no means were we racing. We took our time as needed. Most parts the stairs are an easy to med climb. The views are spectacular from the top and the breeze keeps you cool(ish). The history is fascinating. A must do!

I went here in the afternoon and I was annoyed by the numerous amount of tourists conquering the place for photos and I couldn’t find a spot to take some photos. One useful tip from me: Wake up extra early in the morning just to go here for nice photos.

"Visited during the time of the Perihelia and on a Sunday when people were not at work. The place was completely packed and we were jammed in a crowd that was circulating around the temple with their families and their flowers to place before the relic or the Buddha.Your ticket enables you to go round the temple, the archeological museum, the museum of Raja the elephant Tusker, and the courtyards. It was an amazing if very slow visit, but to see so many devoted people and their families paying their devotions to the temple was an insight into the spiritual nature of Sri Lanka. Buses had been depositing people in groups all along the lake side and parking was a problem, but well worth the effort,Outside we were able to see some of the elephants that had been in the procession last night and they were placidly eating and happy to have someone stand by them, stroke their trunks and pose for pictures ( cost about 500rps). I could not believe I was that close to these magnificent creatures who are probably safer here than in the wild!An extraordinary morning.",2018/08/24,suesalford,"Salford, United Kingdom"
"barefoot is required!! been here twice, and by comparison, I think much better to visit in morning, less crowded. you can visit other places in Kandy later in noon or afternoon. many people from outside Kandy visit this temple, and they need time travel but probably will arrive around 09.00 or 10.00 onwards, so better visit before that. of course when I said less crowded is still crowded comparing to some temples I visited in Sri Lanka. this temple really attracts so many people, probably because Kandy was the last capital of the Sri Lanka Kings. its crowdedness really makes it difficult to see many things. some other info: - don’t imagine hoping to see the tooth as probably driven from the name of this place. - taking picture: be aware that, there is certain place in this temple that you can’t back-siding the spot while taking picture. I witnessed several times visitors ignored (or not reading the sign) immediately approached by guards. - since there is different ticket price between SAARC with the other countries, be sure you have your passport, as they want to make sure your nationality. - Bhikhus (monks) conduct 3 daily worships in the inner chamber at dawn, noon, and evening. - on Wednesdays attract more people as there is symbolic bathing of the relic. it is really crowded as many people hope getting the scented water. all in all, is still worth of visit",2018/08/24,Wilwa_Tikta,Indonesia

"For those of you who like me aren't too fond of heights fear not....it's not as scary as it looks. It's well worth the effort to get to the top, great views. It's a fairly long walk up but there are plenty of places to stop for a break, again I didn't find the walk as tiring as I had feared.

"A lot of history here in a spectacular location, one of my favourite tourist sites in Sri Lanka. Visit the museum and gardens before you climb Sigiriya Rock for background information and artist impressions of how the palace and associated buildings and landscaping might have appeared. The climb is steep but not too hard as you're going up stairs at the pace of the slowest person in the crowd. Everyone is friendly and patient and you're there before you know it. There was a nice breeze up on top so very pleasant exploring. It's sunny and exposed, you'll need to hold onto your hat.",2018/08/23,Catherinetas,Devonport
"We went as part of our tour of Sri Lanka and to be honest, I felt it was a ""must do"" on the trip. We went fairly early in the morning and even then it was very crowded, although having seen photos on Trip Advisor, I realise it wasn't actually too bad. Due to the number of people we were forced to climb at a fairly slow, steady pace (luckily!!) and it was only the heat that made it feel rather strenuous. There are plenty of places to stop and take a break if you do feel tired along the way. The final stage of the climb might be tricky if you fear heights, but it is literally climbing a metal stair-case with a hand-rail, which means there is no need to look down if you would rather not. We sat for quite a while up the top under a shaded tree taking in the view. The trek down was lovely - we saw very few people and couldn't believe how quickly we made it down. Take plenty of water to drink along the way!",2018/08/23,Jenningsburyhouse,"Hertford, United Kingdom"

"Its a temple. Its crowded. You don't get to see very much. Certainly nowhere near the tooth. People go because its the 'thing to do' I was underwhelmed by the whole thing. The building isn't that big or impressive. There were far too many people when we went at 09:30 on a Wed because they polish a mirror or something, we didn't get anywhere close enough to see. It was also our fourth temple of the trip so there was a temple fatigue setting in at this point.

As a foreigner, you’ll be forced to pay an entry fee (not a ticket but a forced donation) of Rs$300 which is approx US$1.90 to enter the temple. If it’s used for the upkeep for the temple it’s worth every cent.The temple has a large collection of antiques donated from all over the world, from statues to jewelleries, watches to antique vehicles on display at the very end of the temple.There’s a Bodhi tree in the middle of the temple ground which I particularly like & it’s very calming & relaxing. People are meditating & praying surrounding this holy tree. Every way you turn is a feast for the eye & mind. I saw a roster walking freely on the ground but not elephants in a chain like others say.

Seemed a bit dodgy as we weren’t sure that the drivers would still be there to bring us back - but they were and we had a really great trip - first through the fishing port which was fascinating, and then around the lagoon, stopping to step out into a couple of the islands and to see the monkey colony. Overall 1.5 hours on the water. It was low tide and we grounded more than once and couldn’t get close onto the monkey beach as a result. Tip: Check tide times maybe ?

Young kids are likely to require carrying to come prepared and bring all your snacks and drinks as once you are on the climb, there is nothing. It’s a well worth hike with spectacular scenery with amazing views all around. The guides went into far too much detail for our family but they were pleasant and helped us all the way. I can see this hike being challenging for the elderly but there are rest stops all the way up. We didn’t really find it a challenge to make it up even carrying a 2yr old.

"Top tip: after you’ve got your ticket from the museum (foreigners only) and you enter the citadel, depending on the time of day you go, you’ll hit a huge, slow moving queue leading up the stairs. Take a right turn just as the stairs begin to ascend. You’ll come across one alternative set of steps that the guides (slyly) have blocked off to boost their trade of queue jumping short cuts. But if you follow the path around further to the right you will see another set of steps leading up that cuts out the vast majority of the queue. Look out for wealthier travellers following a guide up this route and you’ll know you’re on the right track. Take plenty of water as it gets hot. It’ll be worth it.

The traffic getting there was pretty bad so it took us longer than it should of, give around 45 minutes drive to get here. It was school holidays when we visited so the beach was crowded with warm laughter and families having a great time. It was great to observe the happy atmosphere. We were all there to watch the sun do down which didn’t disappoint, we got lots of beautiful photos. This place was buzzing so it felt quite safe, a place where local people hang out, we didn’t see other tourists. We were also surprised that we only ran into one beggar. There are a few strips of restaurants right near the beach side. The beach itself is not amazing because it’s not the clear blue or green colour you would expect in such an exotic place, but for us this visit was definitely a highlight during our trip to Colombo.",2018/08/22,DirtyDewang,

It was challenging at times as there were a lot of people coming and going, but the reward was the views once at the top. The history of the place was well told to us by our guide and I think that makes it all the more worthwhile when you know the story of the Lion Rock.

"As this is a touted ""must-do"" of any Sri Lanka trip, tourists flock there each day by the hundreds, if not thousands. We noted there were quite a number of locals visiting the rock at the time of visit, as our trip in August coincided with school holidays in Sri Lanka.We arrived by 8am at the ticketing booths, however later found out that other people got their tickets at 7.30am! Still, we had plenty of time to climb the rock unimpeded, even though there was already a steady stream of small groups heading up around the same time. Photographers' note: A disadvantage of arriving during early hours is that the sun is not fully risen behind the rock from the main entrance, so pictures may be silhouetted.The climb to the top itself (if there isn't a queue) took us about 50 minutes, allowing for mini-stops to take photos and pauses to enjoy scenery. As we climbed higher, different scenery came into view, and the countryside around the rock expanded. Stone-carved steps soon gave way to steel stairs. There is a section where you may ascend an enclosed narrow spiral staircase - not recommended for those with mild claustrophobia or vertigo. Fashionistas' note: Don't wear loose skirts! (Like the elderly lady in front of me whose skirt kept whooshing upwards).The spiral staircase leads to a section where rock paintings (of half-naked figures) can be viewed. These are prohibited from photography, and kept under scrutiny by staff. The frescoes are mildly interesting, but as there are no interpretative signs, the average tourist probably won't appreciate it much unless accompanied by a guide.You can choose to bypass the rock art gallery and staircase by speaking to staff. This allows you to skip across to the other side and still climb the remainder of the rock palace for the unmissable views and interesting architectural features. We spent another hour easily exploring the top. There were many people clambering across the brickwork posing for photos even by 10am. So again, it really pays to arrive early to avoid as much of the crowds as possible.Upon reaching the bottom once more, there are many more areas and features to see. These may be worthwhile exploring and most have interpretative signs and also numbers. The exit of the attraction takes you past a number of stalls selling drinks, wood carvings, batik clothing and other souvenirs. Bargain buyers' note: The souvenirs here were priced at least double the normal cost at other city-based shops. The drink prices were about the same.Other important things to note: - Entry fee was USD$30 per adult at the time of writing- Hold onto your ticket as staff will check and tear off stubs at different checkpoints- Main exit is a different spot from the entrance, marked ""Carpark for Foreign Tourists""- Shorts and hats are permitted, but hold onto your hat near the summit on windy days!- Bring binoculars for the spectacular views- Hire a guide if you want to be fully immersed in the history and culture of the place",2018/08/21,J7J8J,"Darwin, Australia"

He knows the terraine so well that I could easily say he can drive with his eyes blind folded!If anyone is thinking Yala, I highly recommend Menaka for the job. His number is +94779618415.Menaka, thank you very much for ""wild safari driving"" us in time to catch the sloth bear before he disappeared into the woods.On behalf of the boys and myself, I would like to thank you again for showing us all such a good time.

"We stayed in a fantastic hotel (Wild Coast Tented Lodge) while in the area and wish we stayed in the resort the whole time rather than attempting the safari. The main issue is the number of vehicles that they allow in the park, there are no restrictions so at any one time you are in a convoy of vehicles as you attempt to find wildlife and should anything be spotted then the vehicles swam towards the poor animal. At 6am you have to queue with approx 50 other vehicles which is just horrible. We have been fortunate enough to safari in South Africa on Private reserves and been spoilt by not having any or many vehicles in the area so this was a strange experience for us. Also, wildlife is not obviously abundant - the leopard remains elusive! Yala is a beautiful part of the world with excellent hotels but I would think twice about going on safari here.",2018/08/20,PaddyM570,"Kidmore End, United Kingdom"

I have to admit, physically it was tricky but more than doable as there are opportunities along the way to stop and catch your breath if needed. It’s more the challenge of fears I encountered. It was a scary climb and at times I was terrified. The steepness, it felt unstable even though it wasn’t but make the effort to go to the top. It is definitely worth all the effort to have the cool breeze that hits you when you get there and the views are amazing. Coming down is swift and easier.

"Sadly this part of Sri Lanka hasn’t had rain in many months which made going on safari there very disappointing. Not because we didn’t get to see many animals over three hours but more so the many safari vehicles eager to please their guests so the drivers were aggressive, dangerous at times as they compete to get closest to any animal spotted. At one point there were 30 safari trucks at one point, no one giving way, it was totally shambolic. It was said afterwards that the park is closing for two months due to the drought. Maybe in that time they should find a way to regulate these safari trucks as it’s an accident waiting to happen.",2018/08/19,01tw1969,"London, United Kingdom"

Its absolutely breathtaking.As the stairs are narrow theres usually a line so the tour would easily take 2 hrs.,2018/08/18,lara t,
"So my family and I visited here with our guide. We paid an entrance fee which included the services of a forest guide too. He did not speak English but our guide was luckily able to translate. He pointed out wildlife; we saw a snake, monkey and various birds, pretty butterflies and others. The trek is 4 hours to the viewpoint at the top. Be warned though this is not a casual stroll through the forest! We rocked up with trainers and anoraks and thought we were fine. But there is a lot of climbing and clambering and it took us nearer 5 hours. It is very humid as you would expect. I struggled and didn’t quite make it to the top although the rest of the family did and enjoyed the view. Really hiking boots are required and DEFINITELY pay for leech socks! I didn’t know you could do this or I definitely would have done. We were plagued by leeches all the way round - I tucked my trousers into my socks - but the leeches ate through my (fairly robust sport socks) and my ankles / socks were bright red from the blood!! Not a pretty sight. Shocked the (well prepared) Chinese tourists! I ended up with 5 leech bites and we had to keep stopping to remove the leeches from INSIDE our shoes/ socks as well as outside. Ew. On the way back down we sprayed our shoes with mozzy repellent which seemed to help. Do take plenty of water too - again we were ill prepared.An interesting experience but would have been much easier with the right equipment!There is a little shop you can buy a few welcome snacks/ drinks at the end. There are toilets but women - it’s just a hole in the ground :(.

"We were excited about going here because we love hiking and go to many national parks in England and wherever we go travelling. We teamed up with another couple for the drive from nuwara Eliya which cost us 5,000 rupees and the drive took about an hour. We set off at 5am because we were told it's better to see the views early. When we arrived at the ticket office there was a huge queue and it was freezing! The ticketing is crazy and very disorganised. The couple in our car teamed up with some other Dutch people in the queue to buy a group ticket to the park to save themselves some cash (not sure it saved them that much!) so we had to buy a ticket for ourselves and it was insanely overpriced..I think 7,000 rupees for the two of us. World's end was nice but there were masses of people trying to look at the same view which took the beauty out of it for us and we certainly didn't think it rivalled the lake district. It was a pleasant walk but we wouldn't recommend it. The only thing we did like was how clean the park was and no plastic is allowed in.",2018/08/18,Dendells,

I would actually recommend the morning only as we saw very little in the late morning. Yes, you do have a lot of other people in the park and the roads are bumpy but just ask the driver to stop when you come across different animals as this will allow you to experience and appreciate what the park has to offer. I feel people moaning about the above just raced around trying to see the big animal attractions rather than the whole experience. If you go with the attitude that you will see only a few of the big animals then you will have a better time as it will allow you to appreciate what you come across.

Both was located in different district.2) From the main road in Ella town, u need to walk about 3km-4km to find the main entrance for start the trail. Means u will see the signage of Little Adam's Peak.3) From main entrance, the trail begins with a moderate incline as it winds through tea plantations around 10-15minutes.4) After the tea plantations, u need to follow the steps of stairs trail. I don't know exactly how many steps it's, may be around 300++ stairs. It's will take 20-30minutes to go up depend on your stamina.5) The stairs trail is well-maintained and u can see the spectacular view but beware becausethe steps are not the same height.6) Please wear comfortable and sturdy shoes on your way up. Bring mineral water. Use sunblock/sunscreen, hat or anything u think needed.7) Little Adam's Peak was easy for hikers and moderate trail for others.

"Temple is quite beautiful in many places and the entrance fee is reasonable (1500 for US citizens). Very crowded with those visiting the temple for religious purposes.Main drawback was that a tour guide followed us giving us little choice in whether we wanted a tour. We asked the price and were told it was a “free tour, can choose to make donation”. However, the guide asked for more money when we made the donation we decided on (1000 rupees). So be wary of these guides should they attach on to your group.",2018/08/16,Don H,
"Unlike most temples, this is a combination of temple, education centre and museum - with some wonderful, if in need of attention, old vehicles on display in a rather dingy area at the rear of the building. There's also a beautiful Bodhi tree in the centre of the temple (there were a couple having their wedding photos taken by the tree when I was there) and an interesting display of jewellery and other items in yet another area.Entry fee is R300 and you must remove your shoes (and have your knees covered) before entering the temple - your ticket will also give you entry to the nearby Seema Malaka Meditation Centre.",2018/08/16,Melinda B,"Melbourne, Australia"
"I'm not sure where it all comes from, via the sea to the North of the lagoon, or more locally, but it shamed me to experience it.The lagoon was beautiful and could be again.We were alongside a group of Chinese visitors feeding monkeys on Kakkaduwa Conservation forest (!!!) Where a local guide amused them by throwing a plastic water bottle for the monkeys to open.The lid was discarded and we didn't wait to see if the bottle was recovered.The monkey's looked depressed, and so was I having witnessed this.I know I'm just another ""middle class tourist"", but this was the worst I've seen during 6 weeks in Asia and it made my jaded heart sink a little further.Somebody please take care of this beautiful location and restore it to what it should be.",2018/08/15,allanf556,

"We decided to visit Lion rock after much debate and being told that Pedingula (probably spelt wrong!) was better as it is only 500 rupees.Lion rock is around $30/ 4,800 rupees but we decided to go for it as we were only there once and it was a little safer to do as we were doing a sunset climb. We walked through the museum first - nothing special.The rock however is a different story.. the climb itself is really not too strenuous and will take those who are generally fit around 40/60 minutes to climb even with a little rest in between. The most strenuous part is at the bottom, the first descent up the steep steps! Once you reach the top, WOW! We actually decided to reach the top around 5pm and it was the best thing we could have done.You need all the time you can to truly appreciate the views on offer, especially on the left side when you first climb up, picturesque mountains and an amazing lake.. the picture will never leave me! I have attached the photo!I actually think this view alone offered better views than the other rock as we could see three of the sides of the other rock but I could be wrong and if we had more time we would have done both! Unfortunately for us the clouds were in the way of the sunset but we were thrilled with the trip!

"I was really unsure about going due to the entrance cost being US$30 but I read some reviews and went anyway and I have to say that it was such a great experience. I did get a guide which cost $20 as it had been recommended to do this from a Sri Lankan friend to understand the site in depth. I have to say he definitely also helped out with keeping the monkeys and dogs away! The flight of stairs to the paintings are definitely not for the faint hearted but it all added to the experience. The climb to the top of the mountain, entering at the lion’s feet, was so interesting. It was very windy so wear something that will not blow up with a gust of wind! Also I went around 11am and it wasn’t too, too busy, for those who are not able to make the early morning slot!",2018/08/15,jop555,
We arrived at around 9.30am and the queues were already in place. Due to the volume of people we had to take it slow (needed anyway as a bit of a climb). The views are beautiful and I’m glad we did it however the price is absurd ($30) and the crowds are a bit much. It would definitely be better earlier or slightly off season-we have to travel during school holidays which means places are always busier,2018/08/15,kate w,
"Amazing views from the top, so even if you’re lazy and unfit like myself, the climb is definitely worth it. The downside was the unending mass of people, moving at a constant steady pace, but we went at about 3pm - possibly the busiest time! If heights aren’t your thing you might want to give this a miss. My boyfriend had to bow out when we got to the metal spiral staircase. Also the fear of awakening the swarms of bees and being attacked (as per the warning signs) will keep you alert enough to save any boredom mid-climb.",2018/08/15,LilyTelf,"London, United Kingdom"

"Hikkaduwa was a huge disappointment. The ocean was very, very rough and we could not even enter the water in some areas. We visited at the end of July - it is apparently much calmer after December. The sand is not fine and powdery and there was garbage strewn about. Peddlers were plentiful but mainly tolerable; it was the random men who hang around the beach who were very annoying. Hikkaduwa town is dirty, noisy, and chaotic. Walking down the 'sidewalk' or crossing the road is downright dangerous - the buses and other vehicles fly by pedestrians and each other at fairly high speeds in tight quarters. I am surprised there aren't more accidents. The fumes and pollution from vehicles is overwhelming. Proprietors are aggressive. It seems like everyone is trying to get something from you or sell something to you.

Exciting climb to the top. Nowhere near as hard as it looks. Amazing view along the way and at the top.

I am still afraid of heights but sometimes you just have to seize these opportunities.",2018/08/14,PaddyM570,"Kidmore End, United Kingdom"
We expected this climb to be strenuous but were pleasantly surprised with how easy we found it. We also saw lots of monkeys which was a lovely treat. It was quite crowded which meant the hike was slow in some parts. It is worth popping in to the museum first for a 10 min intro to the rock before the climb. The entrance fee is steep (pun intended!) but worthwhile.,2018/08/14,Becksem,"London, United Kingdom"
"We were there on a Sunday in August (around noon). We saw the long queue, nevertheless we decided to try to go up. - What a mistake!We waited one hour in the queue, but advanced only about 30 meters! The queue was practically standing still. Probably it would have taken us more than 4 - 5 hours to the top! The reason for that is, that many people bypass the queue with the help of (unlicensed) guides using other (unofficial) paths. We were also asked by such a ""guide"" for 20 USD for this unfair procedure.Also people waiting in the queue stand very close, push and jostle, which is extremely annoying.",2018/08/14,E J,

"We did one morning and one late afternoon safari. As others have said, if you have been on safari in Africa prepare yourself to be hugely disappointed, it does not begin to compare.We saw very few animals here. In the morning we saw one elephant and lots of water buffalo and peacocks! We were lucky enough to see a few more elephants (3 at a distance) and a leopard in the afternoon. However, the queue of jeeps to see the leopard was incredible. At the time, it was quite exciting as we got the photo that we really wanted, but afterwards it felt no better than seeing one at a zoo due to the vast number of queuing jeeps.Make sure that your jeep has seat belts and wear them, as once the drivers have a call to tell them about a leopard sighting they all drive at frightening speeds.I actually wish we had not bothered with visiting this part of Sri Lanka as the only reason we went was to visit this national park. We felt that Minneriya National Park was better as we saw so much more wildlife there (many herds of elephants). I do appreciate that safaris are pot luck with what you see on the day, but with the huge amount of jeeps all entering at the same time and speeding round, I can't believe many visitors are particularly lucky here.",2018/08/14,Jenningsburyhouse,"Hertford, United Kingdom"

"This was our second time at Yala. We went there 3 years ago. This time struggled to see a lot, we only saw the back of 1 elephant for 5 seconds running away from us into the bush. We did see a few large crocodiles basking in the sun and some interesting birds.Yala is the most famous park in Sri Lanka and is really busy, lots of jeeps driving around desperate to see an animal. The problem is Elephants, leopards, etc... do not take jeeps wizzing around too well and will change their patterns to stay away from the tracks they use. I am guessing that in time, there will be less and less to see for visitors.For the amount paid for the entrance fee, I am wondering if this is good value for money. The staff at the gates seem very keen to make sure foreigners do not get in at the ""local"" rate too. It sounds like Yala is big business. Is it big Conservation work though?Also some advice on families with young children, the tracks and extremely bumpy and drivers do go through them pretty fast. Young children need to be held.",2018/08/13,Parripu,"London, United Kingdom"

"I was hopefully to see a leopard in Sri Lanka and was told this was my best chance. I booked 3 Safari's into the park with the same driver each time. This really helped as he took us to different parts of the park each time and knew what we had already seen. The tip of 500rs (£2.50) meant he kept coming back. We saw a glimpse of a sloth bear on the first trip, to be honest it could have been anything. We also saw lots of bird life and an elephant. Trip 2 saw more elephants but still no leopard. From getting in the Jeep on trip 3 we knew we had a chance, the driver flew of across the park. However we ended up watching a muddy puddle for an hour as the leopard had been seen their earlier in the day. Finally we got the call and ended up in a jeep frenzy to see a leopard sitting under a tree resting. It was awesome to see and a relief to have got a viewing on our last safari here. Loads of wildlife, too many jeeps but because of the size and vegetation you are not aware of all the jeeps until they all want to see the same thing at the same time. Every few jeeps a Park guide sits in with the driver to keep the jeeps moving past the animal of interest. This means everyone does get a chance to see it and works well.",2018/08/13,nwhitby2017,"Tattenhall, United Kingdom"

"We (my wife and I) booked this through the hotel we were staying at, the Cinnamon Citadel, Kandy. We only had a few hours to spare before moving south down the country and were glad we took this opportunity.We were picked up in a car at the hotel, and driven there in what only took about 15 minutes. It was early morning, roughly 7am, and the park was empty. Other than our guide we did not see anyone else. This made it all the more peaceful. If you're an early riser, i'd recommend going early. It lent itself to some wonderful scenes of mist clearing and the sun starting to break through the trees. Good photo opportunities.As others have said, there are plenty of monkeys going about their daily business. Additional wildlife we encountered included a deer, a few species of butterfly and a kingfisfer.One of the unexpected points of note, was the enourmous Puss-well (Giant Liana) tree. It's about 200 years old and spreads over an area of nearly 2 hectares. That information is thanks to a photo I took of the sign rather than my memory, but the way which the trees branches twisted and grew were certainly memorable and something i'd never seen before.There were longer routes to take, so you could spend more than the couple of hours we did, depending upon how much you enjoy such walks. The scenary within the forest was very good throughout and you also get to see some good views over Kandy at one point. Wildlife was intermittant, which was fine for us. The sections we did were fairly flat. There was one steep section to see a cave, which was optional rather than on the main route.If you book via that hotel, we found the guide Nithan to be very knowledgable. He is someone who is massively passionate about wildlife, and we got on to talking about his current research papers on plastics and how Sri Lanka might implement policies to address the amount currently impacting the wildlife in Kandy and beyond.Overall we throughlly enjoyed this and would happily recommend to enyone who likes fairly easy walks in a beautiful surrounding with a spot of wildlife.",2018/08/13,JimRigg,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom"

Chances are high that you'll catch a glimpse of monkeys.

What an amazing insight to the past. Would definitely advise an early start as it got very busy as we climbed down. Amazing history when you stop to read the plaques. We has a guide and this made all the difference to cover things we may have missed. The views along the way were outstanding. The cave was limited due to the single entrance for entry and exit not a major issue at 7.15am but could be an issue if busy.

The climb up was actually more bearable for us because of the huge crowd as we could go very slowly. I didn’t break much of a sweat up compared to Pidurangala. We went on a Sunday early morning and everyone was there too. It was windy so it was not too hot for us.

I had wanted to visit for over 20 years and the Temple of the Tooth didn’t disappoint.  It is a beautiful building with gorgeous art and objects. Visiting at pooja times is a must - the drumming and atmosphere is unforgettable.,2018/08/12,HungryForMoreMum,"Melbourne, Australia"
"We visited this place in the evening and so lucky to attend the local dancing ceremony with colourful costumes and some kind of fire works. All local pilgrims were very devoted and very disciplined around the place. Ancient arts were amazing, as i remembered they were more than 250 years old. But the place was very crowded and unfortunately we didn't see anything such as sacred tooth relic, because of the crowd. But this was a nice place to visit, and there was a average size reservoir which you can have a boat rides. But if you are planing to visit this place keep in mind to wear full covered dress which is not very colourful. otherwise they don't allow you to go inside the temple.",2018/08/12,geoffry l,"Adelaide, Australia"
It is certainly an interesting place to visit as it's not really your usual Buddhist temple. There are prayer areas but majority of the grounds seems dedicated to a huge collection of Buddhist/Buddhist -related items. More like a museum than a temple. Not sure what to make of it.,2018/08/12,icesiren77,"Singapore, Singapore"
"The beach is pretty nice, but there’s not a lot of space to lay down and enjoy the weather. The sea is very rough in August and it’s not very safe to swim. There are also a lot of locals who try to get you on one of those boats with a glass bottom and they won’t stop pushing you until you walk away. Very annoying and not relaxing at all. There are a few reasonably priced restaurants near the coast that are nice.",2018/08/11,Laura0322,"Utrecht, The Netherlands"
"Thanks to earlier reviewers I booked directly with the Visitors Centre for a 3pm boat ride of 1.5 hours duration for 1300Rp each. We actually pretested the route by tuk tuk in the morning as I have been having language issues with the guy opposite the resort. The fact he thought I wanted a pharmacy when I tried to pronounce Muthurajawela probably says a lot about other tourists! It appears when travelling south from Negombo that the tuk tuk goes the long way round but we were told at the centre that the route indicated on google maps is now impassable. I note also that the price seems to have increased since May. However at Rp2600 fir two plus Rp2500 for the tuk tuk for 3 hours or so (must stay for the return) it was a lot cheaper than the Rp9000 each being quoted by the hotel. (Presumably get there by aircon car, but the boats are all the same on this route). The visitors centre contains some quaint background information, reminiscent of a primary school project. There is a restaurant there but it was closed both morning and afternoon. Take correct money, change was nearly a problem. Pee before you get aboard. The trip itself is along the old Dutch canal for about 30 mins, where water monitors, various kingfishers and moorhens abound, plus the odd local trying to handcatch fish in the water. Then into the lagoon proper, and finally into the maze of what are a form of mangrove here. All very pretty and definitely a surprise after the pollution and noise of the mainland. Plenty of birdlife including great grey herons, cormorants, shags, egrets, kites, sea eagles and what looked like an owl. We didn’t see any monkeys or baby crocodiles. I was sceptical about crocodiles, but have since read they do inhabit lagoons throughout SriLanka. Might think twice now about kite boarding on the lagoon! Would probably book the 7.30 am trip next time. I suspect you can just turn up - each boat seats eight passengers and I never saw any with more than 4 people, two passengers, one driver and one guide. Yes a pleasant way to spend a late afternoon, followed by cocktails at sunset.",2018/08/11,johnaB747HM,"Sydney, New South Wales, Australia"

Leopard sighting is really not guaranteed and you’ll just have to be really lucky. I personally would pay more for a better Jeep (very bumpy) and a team who bothers to bring along an ice box for cool drinks along the way.

"Firstly please don't let this review put you off of visiting this incredible place. It just bugs me when there is over exploitation of such a beautiful haven for natureFirstly: Choose one of the Top 5 Safari providers for Yala.Secondly: Be prepared to hold on for dear life, tracks can be very rough.Thirdly: Show an interest and your Driver/Guide will take you to the less Jeep populated areas of the Park.We done Two Drives, one afternoon and one full day. We saw some incredible sights and scenery largely due to getting further away from the 150+ other Safari Vehicles.Overall this is an incredible place to visit but sadly unless the number of Safari Vehicles entering the park is reduced and strictly limited this place will just become a Crap Tourist Zoo. Sri Lankan Wild Life Department - Please take note and don't destroy this beautiful place for nature.

The temple of the tooth is really impressive and attracts lots of pilgrims and tourists. I was touched by the crowd dressed in white holding flowers and other offerings. Unfortunately there is really a crowd and a big queue to get close to the chamber where the sacred relic is. From time to time it is closed. We had to wait for some time when it closed just as we were almost there. Then we were rushed and could only glance through a little window. Only locals with special permission are allowed inside the chamber. I am a budhist and it was an interesting but somewhat disappointing experience.,2018/08/11,Maria Lucia S,"Rio de Janeiro, RJ"

Best in class world heritage site with amazing views from the top. This is a must do site when visiting Sri Lanka as its centrepiece is a castle built on top of a huge rock and it’s  history dates back to the 3rd century BC.,2018/08/10,seanuma,London
"This place is incredible in terms of the scale of what was built and existed so long ago. The walk around the ruins and outer moats is lovely. We were there early afternoon, so it was hot but not crowded. Once you get to the main rock the steps and climb get quite steep which was fine for us but needs good shoes. To climb the spiral staircase and the final steep staircase on the front of the rock requires a good head for heights. If that is not for you there is a nice flat, open, shady area at the base to watch the other climbers and monkeys. Definitely a must do in Sri Lanka, once inside the paths are clear and signed so no need to pay any extra for a guide",2018/08/10,kgm040,"Sydney, Australia"
"I was very sceptical about this place, but it blew my mind!You can get a tuktuk from the main street in Sigiriya to the ticket office for around 200 rupees. My advice is to go as early as possible because of the crowds and so you wouldnt be on the sunny side while climbing (be there around 7-8a.m.). We waited in line for the tickets for around 15 minutes, and then another 5 minutes to the entrance. The ticket price is 30 US$ per person. Pricey, but worth it! (Keep in mind it is not the Sri Lankan goverment deciding about the prices, it it UNESCO!)Bring comfy shows and lots of water!The climb itself is not as scary as I thought, so dont worry, you will be there in no time. I took us 45 minutes to get to the top, but only because of all the people also climbing. There are a few spots where people with fear of hights could feel uneasy, but they are very short. The top itself is amazing, couldnt believe they actually built something like that! You could spend aprox. 1-1.5 hours on the top just walking around, or sitting and enjoying the view. The way back is around half an hour.There are a lot of guides offering to accompany you to the top, but I did not ask for a price because we decided to go alone.You can go in shorts, no sleeves - not a problem, it is not a holy place.It think it is my favourite place in Sri Lanka, it is really breathtaking.",2018/08/10,Mahmuljinova,"Zagreb, Croatia"

I've read on reviews that people often queue to get in, but we certainly didn't.The 9km loop walk took us just under 3 hours and covers lots of different terrains - spectacular views of Bakers Falls and from Little World's End and World's End. We didn't see any wildlife apart from a few deer from the car when we entered the park.Do wear sensible shoes and be aware that the restrooms are extremely unpleasant, which I was surprised about considering the price they charge for entrance to the park.",2018/08/10,Jenningsburyhouse,"Hertford, United Kingdom"
"Oh dear far too many jeeps.We did a afternoon trip and an all day.We did get to see fantastic wildlife thanks to our guide Sudu, but the queues to get in is ridiculous.Maybe the park should think about reducing the numbers by half but charging double to compensate.I really don't think it's fair on the parks wildlife to have so many jeeps chasing around.The amount of jeeps really needs to be addressed.This isn't any good if you have a bad back, I would have serious concerns taking young children due to the way you are thrown around in the jeeps.However we were lucky enough to see the leopard on 3 occasions, elephants, buffalo, monkeys, crocs, mongoose.We saw so many beautiful birds both at watering holes in in the trees.Our guide Sudu was excellent and very knowledgeable as well as having hawk eyes at spotting things.Overall a great experience",2018/08/10,ANNIELOUISE01,"Lightwater, United Kingdom"

As if you were in an old rollercoaster, but then for hours long.We saw a lot of animals we saw before, but after 7 hours of shaking we saw a black bear (for 5 seconds). No leopard.Of course that's nature, but is it worth the 2 x 4 hours jumping and bumping in the jeep and the two hours mandatory break between 12:00 and 14:00?

Tickets are 1500 rupees per person, you buy them on the ticket machine behind the Tooth temple.

You will have to be barefoot, but there is a place to leave you shoes.They are very strict at the entrance, so long pants and shoulders covered are a must. Most places let guys in with normal shorts, but here are very strict - only if the shorts are longer than the knee. If they do not let you in you have an option of buying pants or cover up close, but for an exspensive price of 1000 rupees.All in all, I would not go if I knew it was nothing more than a lot of people pushing around in queues that leads nowhere.",2018/08/10,Mahmuljinova,"Zagreb, Croatia"

The canal offered large water monitors and some birds, rhe open lagoon was spectacular but my favourite was the mangroves along the river. We saw many different birds , Macaques.

On top of that, no pun intended, as you climb, and when you reach to top, the views are amazing. Your one chance to spend some time in relative peace, is to aim to stay at the top until sunset when, with luck, the sun and cloud will oblige you. Don't leave it too late to go to the top as there are cut off times for making the ascent, around 4.30pm, from memory, but check when you are there.

"What we expected and what we got were two totally different things. It should be a nice drive around in a jeep with a guide showing you the abundant wildlife in the park. Not so. The jeeps have seen better days, 50% of the seat belts didn't work and you really need your seat belt because the drivers go at about 50 mph, using the roads as a race track, to get to the ""alleged"" spotting of a sloth or leopard. You get to the spot along with 30 or so other jeeps all revving their engines overtaking each other and in a traffic jam. It is madness and so unhealthy for those poor animals to be hounded like that. We spent an hour tearing around from place to place which was terrifying, with dust flying around and jeeps overtaking one another. The second hour was much improved as we did go to other places in the park other than the race track. But by then the whole experience was ruined and we would never recommend that anyone visits there.

My only caution is when going up/down to the very top hold on to your children's hands as small children can easily slip through the safety rails. If you have any fear of heights, you're best to stay at the lion's paw as the final stretch up is not for the faint hearted.

This was one of the most expensive attractions we went to in sri lanka. It was amazing to see but I thought the views were better from pidarangala rock opposite. Lots and lots of stairs! Worth going all the way to the top.,2018/08/07,en14,
"You are probably reading this as you are having the same dilemma as we did, do you cough up $30 each to go and see this place?? Or do you pay 500 rupees and climb Pidurangala (the hill opposite) to see Sigiriya. We diliberated about this and asked locals and travelers. In the end we did both! And we did not regret it. We loved Sigiriya, it is pricey, however if you go to the museum and explore the whole grounds as well as climbing to the top you get the most out of your money. The history is amazing and I recommend going to the museum before or after the hike up as you appreciate what it looked like all those years ago. 20 minute walk and you are at Pidurangala which is an amazing view with very few tourists, this is a lovely treat after the crowds at Sigiriya. So in conclusion, do both! You won't regret it.",2018/08/07,ChristopherD1947,
"Definitely go early to beat the heat and tourists. I suggest 7am. We were amazed at the cues as we were descending.You do want to be confident with heights if climbing to the top, though stairs and hand rails are everywhere. We were two families of 8, make sure to arrange with your driver and all the party are aware where to meet at the end, In our party a couple of the kids ended up back at the beginning, as there are several ways out! Was easily sorted with the locals and the drivers all looking out. It just showed us how the locals are genuinely looking after and care about the tourists.",2018/08/07,Ruth W,
"So much walking and not all of it requires going up stairs! Actually, even if you don't want to reach the top, there are some stairs to navigate when you decide to depart. This was perfect for me because although I wanted to make it to the top, I decided to spend more time in the museum and gather up all the information and history of the place. My friend took the direct route up to the stairs and the summit while I took a more roundabout and leisurely self-tour around the grounds below after leaving the museum.The museum is worth a visit because it's full of history. Also you can get information on the ruins and buildings that once stood at the site in addition to industry, culture, and how people generally lived. Even if you don't plan on hiking to the top, do plan on spending a hour or two in the museum if you really want to soak up the knowledge before checking out the actual site and then another hour or so walking around. Get there as early as possible. Do bring something to drink. Do wear a hat. Don't forget your sunscreen. Watch out for pickpockets! Those monkeys are faster and more nimble than you are ! ;-)",2018/08/07,Kumi M,"Palo Alto, California"
Amazing landscapes in this beautiful National Park. We spent the morning here birdwatching. This is a very popular place on the weekend and even though we were at the gates at 6.00am there was a big queue of visitors waiting to purchase entry tickets. Early morning is the best time to see the “cloud forest” as the mist dispersed later in the day. The visitor centre has an informative display about the park and is also worth a visit. Very basic snacks and drinks are available in a small stall near the visitor centre.,2018/08/07,yolc,"Sydney, Australia"

If you love your privacy and don't need any facilities in order to enjoy the beach - this is the place to go. The bonus - a 2 minutes boat ride back, you are back in town.

"The walk through the park was great, and not particularly challenging. I would definitely recommend it even if the cloud cover prevents great views from World's end, essentially it is just a big valley and you can see similar views around Ella. The main issue is the queue to get into the park, we left early 5.am, but a flat tire on the way delayed us and put us right in the middle of a queue. The ticket purchase is disorganised, with many of the drivers for tourists pushing right to the front (ours stayed in the car). I would recommend leaving early and then going towards the waterfall first so you are moving in the opposite direction to many tourists.

"What a pitty. Yala National Park is a true sanctuary for wildlife in Sri Lanka and home to 25 leopards in Sector 1 alone (the only Sector out of 4 you can visit). There are herds of elephants, water buffalos etc = a lot to see. UNFORTUNATELY Safari drivers do not act like responsible guides - they drive the safari vehicles like on they were part of the Formula 1 racing teams. Leopards is what most visitors want to see - and drivers will do anything to get to a Leopard sighting in time. Speed limit is 25 km/h - our driver passed 80 km/h with wildlife runing for their life - this did not stop until we almost bumped into the leopard after 2-3 kilometers of reckless driving. On top of this there are far too many safari vechicles in the park - sometimes up to 20 or 30 in one row. On our 2nd drive we asked for an educated ranger from Yala National Park service. We got a nice guy, but unfortunately he did not speak English.....The Yala Park service must address the education of drivers as well as their behaviour. Park service should also set a maximum of vehicles in the park. Yala is unique and should stay this way....(now 400.000 visitors per year - a few years ago only 100.000 per year). Start by educating your own guides and banning speeding drivers in the park..",2018/08/05,DK-Always-Explore,"Copenhagen, Denmark"
"Granted, I've never been on a safari before, but some of the negative things written about this place were not part of my experience of it. We went in low season on a week day, which was hellishly hot, but it also afforded less traffic in the park and the tour provider I found claimed they did not follow the same route as many other safari tours, which turned out to be true. Although we did race to a couple of spots where other jeeps had congregated to see something, we were on our own for much of the day, only occasionally passing another jeep, mostly in the afternoon which seems to be the busiest period (best for spotting leopards apparently?). We saw a number of animals, always cutting the engine and rolling to a stop when we spotted them and trying not to disturb them too much or get too close, and our guide told us about the park/government's efforts to maintain the park, like supplying water to the waterholes during drought periods, thereby making it a little easier for the animals to get through the dry season. I do agree that the park authorities should limit the number of trucks entering per day, otherwise they will likely lose what they have right now, so if you're going, you're better off picking your tour company carefully, making sure they're reputable and environmentally and socially responsible, and going during low season or at least on a week day. Don't go cheap just because you can, you will probably regret it.A final word of advice - also make sure you pick a safari company that provides a guide AND a driver. This did not seem to be the case for many trucks we passed, and we all wondered how the people on safari were managing to spot most things without a guide?! Like, they were just driven around and the driver would stop when he saw something and maybe point, but I can't see how he could have talked to them much about it from all the way down in the cab when they were sitting all the way up in the viewing seats? Having our own guide, we learned so much, about the park, about the vegetation, about the animals. We asked lots of questions and our guide answered them all, all the while spotting things we would never have noticed or known exactly what we were looking at. He clearly cared about the animals and the park a lot and it made our experience of the place mean something more than just running around and taking photos of animals because they were there.",2018/08/05,denikunai,"Brisbane, Queensland, Australia"

In some strange twist, it seems like we may have been the ones to avoid the crowds as we passed lots of tourist buses coming down the hill, as we went up!As you can see from the photos,visibility was not so much of an issue for us.Absolutely stunning walk.

"The beach at Mount Lavinia is one of the most popular spots in Colombo, whether it’s for taking a cool dip in the bright blue ocean, or just to soak up some sun. The beautiful stretch of fine sandy shore paired with foaming waves at Mount Lavinia attracts families and young cliques alike. You will find on the beach, children running around, chasing each other and playing with the sand while their parents stand close by with watchful eyes and take in the sea breeze and picturesque scenery. Some are seen taking their canine friends out for a walk, and couples can be spied taking a stroll, hand in hand along the sea’s edge. The beach is also a favourite choice for school field trips, picnics and photo shoots.",2018/08/04,ricshanshibly1986,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia"

On approaching the security check the pointe to our legs: that needed covering, so I went back to the hostel to get our Sarongs that we had forgotten.After entering (it was very busy because of a long weekend for the Sri Lankans) we had to find out on the tickets: apparently they just introduced autmatic ticket counters, and for ""foreigners"" with the exclusion for people from Malaysia and some other countries, we managed to buy our tickets (1500 roepies per person). The tickets were valid in the whole temple complex, including the musea.We entered the temple after leaving our slippers and were welcomed with an extra ticket with a DVD-inside...On the ground floor there was not much space to move around because of barriers they had put up for maintainceworkers (repairing the golden roof).On the first floor there were a lot of people praying and offering flowers. There was a monk or priest receiving the gifts and blessing the givers.The door behind which the shrine for the tooth was placed was closed, so there was not much to see.After leaving the temple we collected our slippers and were more or less forced to give a donation to the person behind the desk. After I put our small donation in the donationbox, he looked very unsatisfied because I did not give the money in his hands...We took the rest of our time to visit the museum on Boeddism around the world and the Raja museum on the famous elephant.",2018/08/04,BVvdB,The Netherlands
Lots of steps - yes but really it was over before we had begun.We got to rock early and had no crowds at all. Made it to the top with no one else in sight. Beautiful views.

"The price may seem a bit steep but this UNESCO world heritage site is worth the effort as a major piece of Sri Lankan history. As others have said, definitely go early- not just because of the heat, but to avoid It getting too crowded. Even by the time we were coming down at 10.30 the crowds were building. This is not something to do if you have a problem with heights, the spiral staircases and ascent past the Lion’s paw will be challenging. There were a number of people having melt downs and blocking the stairs for others.At the top, it was very windy, so hold onto your hats! But the views were spectacular and it’s amazing to think of the effort they went to to build something there. There is no or very limited information provided so a good guidebook is advised. This is not a religious site so you can wear shorts and don’t need to cover your shoulders. The frescos are great, the mirror wall a bit less so. You can only view these things once (via your ticket) and you don’t come down the same way you go up so make sure you don’t accidentally miss them by thinking you’ll go back to them! And it’s worth walking around the rest of the gardens/ site as there are some great viewpoints.",2018/08/03,517katharinez,

"This was our first safari and my daughter was very excited even with the 5am start. The driver was very good making sure we were comfortable and seatbelted in. We set off and after a 30min drive and lots of speed bumps were we queuing to get a pass and then to get in the park. We had this prepaid with our tour company. The aim it appears to gain revenue stream to maintain the reserve but also to space out the large number of vehicles entering the reserve. It was a bit chaotic with vehicles moving all around the site with sri Lankan driving rules of overtaking still being applied. The drivers were talking to each other to ensure locations of animals were shared to make sure we all got the best experience. Our trip consisted of seeing: - cows, water buffalo, monkeys, crocodiles, mongoose, wild boar, deer, land monitor lizzards, elephants, chamelion, large number of birds, peacocks all in 3 hours.

So you know, I’m about 157cm and 55kgs so average weight and fitness. The second part of the walk is literally climbing rocks. You have to traverse to a second mountain top.

If any traveller needs the eye catching sun rise view have to be on top of the mountain by atleast 6 am.

The temple itself is really beautiful and I would recommend getting a guide especially if you’re not buddisth and would like to know more about it. They do charge a quite expensive enterance fee (1500 rupees) and the guide will charge you as well even though he will tell you to pay him as much as you think he deserves. They also ask for tips when you are retrieving your shoes. Keep in mind that there’s a strict dresscode - covered legs for both men&women and covered shoulders for women. Also, don’t get your hopes up that you will see the actual tooth! It is a quite pricey attraction but I wouldn’t say it wasn’t worth the visit.

"We enjoyed this walk, and the views from world’s end and little world’s end, and also the waterfall.However, some previous reviewers on this site had described the walk as being “effortless”and “virtually flat” which is simply not true.This walk was about 9km long, and included several parts that were sharp inclines or ascents. It definitely requires a moderate degree of fitness. Make sure to wear sturdy walking shoes, use plenty of sun protection and take plenty of water with you.We left extremely early in the morning to beat the mist. Although it was raining and awful when we set out, the fog lifted and we had clear views by the time we reached the attractions.World’s end is really just a big valley- there is no hole into the earth as had been described to us.If you know what you are setting out to see and what the walk will be like you will be satisfied.",2018/08/02,Alison T,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates"

"The biggest disappointment of our Sri Lankan tour, how this so called “national park” has not attracted the attention and ire of wildlife welfare organisations utterly beggars belief. If you are a genuine animal lover, please boycot this awful place until it is properly managed and run and the welfare of the wildlife is significantly improved. If you want to eat dust, smell fuel and be rattled around in jeeps for hours on end that are fit only for the scrapyard, then Yala is the place for you. If you want to view wildlife in an authentic setting, then forget it. No zoo would be permitted to mistreat animals in this way. There appears to be no limit to the number of vehicles permitted to enter one small zone of the park, and so the laudable efforts of local hotels and businesses to promote eco tourism are rendered completely pointless by what is being permitted within the park. A great deal of press in 2004 focused on the fact that no animals at Yala appeared to have been killed in the devastating tsunami. Having visited, one might suspect that the reason was that very few animals remain in zone one of the park since they have been driven out by noisy smelly jeeps and appalling behaviour by so called drivers/trackers and tourists. The only “tracking” done here is via mobile phone from driver to driver, so if any poor animal is foolhardy enough to put in an appearance, jeeps race across the park to surround it, two and three deep, causing the animal great distress and forcing it to retreat. The standard of the roads, vehicles and driving is utterly appalling, so much so it is amazing tourists are not killed or severely injured on a regular basis, and our driver on the first day was so reckless he was given an on the spot one week ban by park rangers. Deservedly so! The park is undoubtedly scenic in places, but it is a dead loss for wildlife viewing as you spend most of the time tearing round the park in search of a leopard at dangerous speed or sat in traffic jams. Your best chance of seeing a leopard is on the photos on the big billboards that line the roads to and from Yala since the “trackers” here are more likely to run one over as it flees in terror than to spot one lazing on a rock or a tree. The park represents everything that can possibly go wrong when tourist numbers are not properly managed, but this entire region of Sri Lanka is so dependent on Yala that I cannot see this changing in the near future, if ever. Do yourself, and the wildlife, a big favour and steer well clear of Yala. The other national parks are currently much better run, and we saw animals at much closer range just driving around Sri Lanka and in the hotel grounds. If you have been on proper safaris in places like India or Africa, you will be bored rigid at Yala and utterly appalled by what is going on there. Why animal welfare organisations are not surrounding Yala with placard waving protestors is a mystery! An utter disgrace to the people and country of Sri Lanka!",2018/08/02,DAVID D,"Newcastle-under-Lyme, United Kingdom"

Lovely walk with great views across the valley and to Ella rock. The path is easy and anyone can do it. There are a lot of steps towards the top so if your knees are not to o good just take it slowly. You can return to Ella via 9 arch bridge.Retrace your path to the entrance to the park then turn right and follow the road. After 30 mins or so there is a sign to the bridge. There are locals who are happy to point the way.

No tooth.Everybody is pushing and this is oppressing if you are short like me.This is a beautiful temple for the locals who pray and offer gifts. I don't see the point for us, tourists, to prevent them to practise their religion because we were so many inside, taking room in a place we don't need to be.

"We just loved Galle Fort. It's ramparts are a pure joy to walk along and see the views of the harbour, the sea and Galle Town. The highlight was probably the area around the clock tower where you can see the old slave bastion where transported slaves were held while ships restocked with provisions. The lighthouse is pretty cool too although it's much younger than the ramparts dating only from 1938.The streets within the fort are beautiful and packed with charming cafes, lovely Dutch and Portuguese colonial buildings and quaint churches. The best thing to do is just stroll and allow yourself to get lost as you will always hit some part of the ramparts within minutes and following those in either direction will always lead you to the gate.It's a UNECSO World Heritage site and is well deserving of that title. Wonderful place.",2018/07/31,Bozeman-Dublin,"Dublin, Ireland"

There are so many different bird species as well!! However, I couldn’t help but leaving the park feeling a bit disappointed. I feel as though the drivers won’t leave the park until they hunt down a bear or leopard. When we did come across these animals it was complete madness!!! So many cars fighting to get the best spot- there was shouting, beeping and racing amongst the cars. I really didn’t enjoy it.Something must seriously be done about the amount of cars coming in this park before it gets out of control!

We did two safari drives from Tissa, one in the mid to late afternoon when it starts to cool down enough for the animals to emerge from slumber and one the following dawn before the heat of the day puts the animals undercover!We saw lots of elephants often very close to the jeerp, some with adorable babies. We also saw lots of leopards including one which incredibly walked right up to the car and along the road in front of us.Plenty of water buffalo, peacock, mongoose and crocodiles.Some stunning plant life, rock formations and watering holes where the animals collect.A wonderful place, an absolute must see in my opinion.",2018/07/28,Bozeman-Dublin,"Dublin, Ireland"
"We had 2 trips around Yala and were left disappointed by them both. Not because of the wildlife (we saw a reasonable amount of that), but the volume of traffic and ‘scrum’ of drivers to get the best view of any sighting....... Even though we visited at low season, there were hundreds of jeeps in the park on both our evening and morning drive. Our guide explained the complex issues around the park authorities trying to limit vehicles in the park to 300 at any one time and said at high season there are often in excess of 500. As an example, our morning drive we left our hotel at 5.15 and were queuing at the gate at 5.40 for it to open at 6am, and we were still the 77th vehicle to go in (we got into the park at 6.23).The park itself is beautiful and there are many gorgeous views and sightings if you keep away from the main tracks (which explains our 3* rating). Once you hit the main drag then it is a city-style scrum of drivers vying to give their clients the best view (in the sense that it may lead to a better tip). Our one Leopard sighting was a ridiculous jostle of many vehicles with gesticulating drivers flashing lights and jockeying for a view. When we eventually got to the spot (20 mins after arriving), the Leopard was resting in long grass before it got up, turned its back on the jeeps and disdainfully walked into the jungle. It pretty much summed it up really....... We felt sad to have contributed to this when we were there.",2018/07/28,Herefordnomads,"Hereford, United Kingdom"
"Visited Galle Fort today. On the train from Hikkaduwa where we're staying we met a main who claimed he worked at the tourist information centre in Galle. He told us a while bunch of things which sounded reasonable and eventually got around to suggesting he would show us the cheapest tuk-tuks to go to the best places. Honestly if he hadn't started talking about his family who had bought really cheap gemstones he might have caught us. As it was, we decided to go to the tourist information centre which is across the road from Galle train station. This is what the man at the info centre told us:1. The fort is NEVER closed2. There are no such things as government tuk-tuks3. The only thing to see in Galle or near Galle is the Fort. Anyone saying you should go to see anything else is trying to take you for a ride. 4. Anyone claiming to be working for Sri Lankan tourism will NOT be hanging around the park gates or the train and bus stations. They'll be working in a tourism office like our guy was.And he asked us to tell other people to not believe anyone telling you anything that contradicts the above, because he doesn't want tourism in his country to be damaged by these very smooth con artists.",2018/07/28,denikunai,"Brisbane, Queensland, Australia"

"We really enjoyed the short but tough hike up from Ella town to Little Adam's Peak for stunning views of the surrounding countryside.It was a very, very hot day on our ascent which made it tougher so bring plenty of water and a hat.The walk starts off as a steep broken stone path that eventually turns into steep steps and, as you get closer to the peak, a dirt trail.Take your time and it's not a particularly hard climb. The altitude makes you a little short of breath but with a steady rhythm or plenty of short breaks it will take you maybe 30 or 40 minutes depending on your fitness. It took us 25 minutes bit other told us they were climbing for twice that.At the top there are three or four viewing points along the ridged peak. It makes for great photos.

Once on the path it is super easy to follow and there are plenty of people to follow if you are unsure. It was a nice relaxing walk through tea plantations until you reach the steps which are a bit steeper. It doesn't take long to get up the steps and the views on both sides were lovely!

Despite the crowds we had a brilliant time and the views from the top are stunning.Our top tips/info- it's $30 per person and cash only- arrive as early as possible, it gets crowded and hot- if there are queues at the beginning of the ascent (before the cave painting) you can take a right (signposted foreigners car park) then the second set of stairs to the left take you up and bypass the queue! Guides in this area will try and charge you for this ""short cut"" but it is open to anyone.- buy water and go to the toilet by the ticket counter, there's no where else- there are lots of steps but with queues you take it slowly and there are lots of places to take a break so you don't have to be super fit to make it to the top.",2018/07/27,Esmeralda_UK,"London, United Kingdom"

Avoid Sunday at all costs if you can. The temple was packed with local devotees and we had to wait forever to enter the temple. Oh, and the Rs 1500 ticket was only available for purchase via machine (exact change only)....might only be an early morning thing because the attendant booths were closed at that hour.

It's possible someone will offer their help to get you up there, but that is actually their job and they will expect you to pay them... It's not so much money but good to be aware of that.

Easy to walk there and then walk around (I would say child friendly), it costs half of what the Botanical Gardens does (662 rupees)- it still annoys me when you have to pay to enter such places, but maybe I have been spoilt back home with free entry. Anyway, it is a very well preserved natural park full of wildlife. I saw deer, butterfly, monkeys and even an eagle soar overhead. You can hear so much more though.

You have to give your shoes in and pay to get them back when you've finished. It cost me 200 slp to get 4 pairs of shoes back. The building is beautiful but be aware that its sacred and you need to show respect at all times. We also went into a seperate hall that described the history of the relic. We also went to the Kings house which was fascinating.A good insight into Budhism.,2018/07/25,matthewandpaula,southampton

It's the holiest Buddhist site in Sri Kanka and is accordingly majestic and ornate The Buddha Tooth is inside a silver stupa that is visible to you as you pass by a small door within the temple.The big ceremonial prayer room for dignitaries is well worth visiting too with its stunning iconography and big golden Buddha. It also has 26 (I think, - I cant temember exactly how many) golden panels explaining the origin and development of Buddhism and how the tooth came to rest here in Kandy.All the while drums beat, flower petals are syrewn, prayers are chanted, music plays and incence burns as the monks tend to the worshippers.The octagon room is wonderful too displaying ancient palm leaf books and scriptures.Huge in scale and wonderfully ornate, an absolute joy to behold.",2018/07/25,Bozeman-Dublin,"Dublin, Ireland"

"Sigiriya is an amazing place. The whole complex is just mesmerising. The Lion Rock itself is it's centrepiece obviously, and rightly so. It's a tough climb in the heat and you'll need a modicum of fitness and plenty of patience as much of it rough rock steps or steep metal stairs that vmcan be narrow. Plenty of rest stops available so take your time! The views from the top are worth the haul! Interesting royal ruins at the top too, especially the water reservoir supplied by monsoon rains and equalised by pressure from a huge u- bend type tunnel from the surface below.Beautifully preserved cave paintings are there to be admired on the way up. They are still astonishingly vivid despite their millennial age.The base of the rock is littered with caves like the Cobra Head and all are marked by signs. There are beautiful gardens that are worth enjoying before or after you ascend and a huge moat and water features that equalise the reservoir on top of Lion Rock.There is an okay interpretive centre that's well worth a visit if you have the time with models, photos and a short film about the rock.One of the highlights of any trip to Sri Lanka and an absolute must see.",2018/07/24,Bozeman-Dublin,"Dublin, Ireland"
"Sigiriya is magnificent, one the highlights of our trip to Sri Lanka, no doubt about it.The Lion Rock is the obvious draw and the views from its flat top are magnificent. The climb is difficult in the heat and is mostly iron staircase and rough hewn steps cut into the rock. If you have decent fitness it will be no problem, if not fit then take your time as there are plenty of rest points.The Citadel has beautiful paintings on the Cliffside that you visit on the way up and they are astonishingly well preserved given their age and beautiful in their detail.There are ruins at the top too, all with signs to gell you what they are, the Palace remains basically. Including an ingenious water tank that's filled from below by monsoon rains and water pressure through as massive U bend!Anyway, it's an utterly amazing sight and a total must see.",2018/07/24,Bozeman-Dublin,"Dublin, Ireland"

"We went to this place because we saw it highly ranked on Tripadvisor and we were absolutely delighted that we visited it. This is several temples rolled into one and has other attractions such as a museum attached to it. The main temple has huge idols and you will stand and stare at it in awe and devotion. The Bo tree can be viewed from multiple heights. Do not forget to visit the various temples including the temple with the rows and columns of meditating figures on the roof, that is a very unique sight to behold. The various statues will definitely have an impact on you and you will feel like closing your eyes and meditating for a while or praying, as you will see some of the people do. As a temple, it evokes the right feeling of worship. The museums were worth seeing especially if the old guide is there inside to talk to you and tell you about some of the artifacts. They have some old Mercedes and Rolls Royce cars too! And I was fascinated with some of the old collections of cameras and video cameras they had. Brought back memories of the past as I remembered the models I had owned! Keep at least one hour for viewing. There is an entry fee for foreigners but it gives you entry to another nearby temple as well which is also worth visiting. The people at the fee counter are friendly and helpful. You will have to leave your shoes near the fee counter and travel barefoot. Definitely a MUST VISIT temple in Colombo!",2018/07/24,Balwant S,"Bengaluru, India"
An amazing historical Sri Lankan heritage site. Stunning views from the summit. Top tip - aim to get there by 8am to avoid the queues and the heat!,2018/07/23,Rob w,
Entrance to Sigiriya cost $30 USD. I think they only took cash. There is a museum that is very informative and after that you can start to explore the grounds. The hike up has many stairs so be aware and bring water. The views from the top were beautiful. Another FYI - the winding stair case takes you to the mirrored wall which is quite short. I also see now that the views from the Pidurangala are quite impressive also. Perhaps consider doing both?I also went a little camera happy for the families of torque macaques living there.,2018/07/23,BGarde,"Georgetown, Canada"

"Yes it’s a big climb, but totally worth it! Get there as early as possible to avoid the heat and crowds ( opens at 7 I think) Take a moment to research the history and then imagine it as you walk through the grounds past the walls of moats and ruins of buildings. Your quads will love the workout - don’t be daunted by the steepness, there are railings all the way. Go slow on the way down though.

This park is famous for its leopard population along with other animals.Were very fortunate to view leopard eating his kill, a deer. Inspite of many vehicles loaded with visitors parked nearby, leopard was enjoying his breakfast. Please visit this park with guide & he will take you guaranteed animal sightings. Safari is approximately 4 hours on a mud road. We could see many deers, bisons, wild Boars, elephants, rabbits, crocodiles & many varieties of birds. Abundant wildlife. We also spotted 3 leopards crossing the road ( mother & 2 young ones) thereby taking our leopard tally to 4.After about 2 hours safari, vehicles stop for rest near sea shore.

"A place to visit to understand the history of Sri Lanka, as it was originally a Dutch fort before the English took over Sri Lanka. There are quite a few hotels in Galle Fort itself and we ourselves stayed in one. There are also a few restaurants catering to the holiday makers staying in the fort area. but be aware that they realise they have a captive market. perhaps staying outside the fort is a better idea. there is a lot of history here , old churches dating back a few hundred years, traces of the old hospital , the fort walls are still very much intact. i think the whole place could be covered in half a day. so we did take side trips out . like visiting a turtle sanctuary just outside Galle.

"We fell in love with Sri lanka 2 years ago, and since its only a 4hr flight from Dubai, we go as often as we can. Trying a new beach everytime. Hikkaduwa is bwautifull (not as lovely as Bentota).During our last trip in Hikkaduwa we were walking along the beach at aroumd 8pm in search of a seafood restaurant. As we walked pass the Hikka Tranz hotel, there was a young lady sitting on the beach. A few metres away from her there was a low hanging tree and I saw this Sri Lankan sitting there, watching her, thinking since it was dark he cant be seen. It was eerie. I walked up to the hotel security that was near thr pools,and informed them.We found a restaurant on the beach not far from where we saw this guy hide.Waiting for our food I saw my husband being distracted. A young woman came up from thr beach, looked at the menu and turned back towards the beach to walk back the way she came. My husband jumped up and went to her, spoke to her briefly and she turned back towards the restaurant walking through towards the main rd. Its then that my husbanded pointed out to me a man who was following the girl. When se stopped at the restaurant to view the menu, he walked past just a few steps and stood in the shadows watching her. Luckily my husband was observant and said that he saw them drom a diatance already. While he spoke to the lady, he pointed out the man, who was startled and turned his back.When she walked through the restaurant, he made a dash through the alley way next door to the main road as well. Luckily she got a tuk tuk. I could swear it was the same guy sitting under the bushes at the tree.I was so shaken by it all.So ladies, PLEASE be careful. Dont walk alone on the deserted beaches at night. Please.",2018/07/22,SonjainDubai,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates"
"I definitely loved Hikkaduwa beach, I don't know how it is during peak season but I was here in July. There wasn't a lot of people and I loved it. It felt like a clean beach to just stroll in and relax in. It was also a good beach to swim in. One side has bigger waves and rocky while the other is sandy.  They also have wild turtles swimming here where the locals help you get seaweed to feed the turtles so it will come to shore. I initially saw a crowd of people and asked what was happening. I was curious. I was saddened though that a local approached me and asked for money for me to see the turtle--- they said if i didn't give them money then it wouldn't come to shore. I dive anyway, so I just walked away and let it be. However, they do exist in the area. You can see them naturally in knee length deep, of course, the locals are just trying to get money out of you. I generally loved my whole trip in Sri Lanka --- it felt safe even when I was alone. What I got really tired of though is tuktuk drivers over charging tourists. In Hikkaduwa, the locals would approach me every so often because most were in groups and I was alone. Don't get me wrong, I love mingling---I am a people person. I love meeting new people and I like interacting wiht locals but in Hikkaduwa it was a bit much! I would laze in the beach andthey would sort of wake me to just strike a lot of conversations, usually sales related. Often, a group of french people rescued me because they kept asking about my hotel and if I wanted to come over which of course I didn't. I do love mingling with locals but it just gets a tadbit too muich if they constantly come when you are lazing and resting. I guess, I was a target since most were in groups or couples and I was alone. All else, I still did enjoy Hikkaduwa.",2018/07/22,simplykarina,"Manila, Philippines"

One the most holy places in srilanka where you could see the past supiror building construction still wonder how it can be done in the yester years,2018/07/22,aryaratne,Sri Lanka
"Friends and I went before the evening offering (6:30-8) so that we check out everything before the unveiling of the golden mini stupa which supposedly houses the tooth. You literally line up for a fair chunk of time (second floor), despite being distracted by other large tusks and drumming on the first floor, only for a millisecond glimpse into the golden booth to see the golden stupa. It sometimes closes and you’re left to continue to queue. It is absolutely packed with people, especially locals who are offering lotus flowers and prayers, staying there for several hours. The experience is surreal so my advice is to go before the offering and get in line on the second level 15min before offering starts. To fill in your time I would greatly recommend visiting the world Buddhism museum which was phenomenal. It’s 1st world standard with presentations from each country’s Buddhism perspective, mostly Asian. Informative and creative, you can easily spend an hour+ there. NB: you cannot take photography of the tooth’s stupa during offering. Outside of offering times it’s unavailable to be seen.Images are second floor before offering, and second on first floor with drum ceremony.",2018/07/22,Jenayyy,"Sydney, Australia"
"Visited the Temple of the Tooth on my last morning in Kandy. The temple itself is very nice to walk around and if you check online there are special times of the day when ceremonious events take place you might want to visit for.Only problem I had, and which I would warm any other female travellers of, is that wearing clothing which fully covers you may not be enough. The lady was really rude and rough picking at my clothing and wouldn’t let me in to the grounds of the temple. I had a long loose black top with a long sleeve loose light black cardigan over trainers with full length thick leggings type trousers. The lady let non-Caucasian women enter in leggings but refused to let me in for some reason and her rudeness, and my being forced to then buy a robe off the street to wrap around myself tainted my experience if I’m honest as I felt I was treated very unfairly as I had dressed respectfully of the temple. I am not an amateur Norman insensitive traveller so I found this a very negative experience. Once inside though there were lots of ladies in knee lengths skirts and t shirts so I cannot advise what dress code is therefore , I would just recommend women wearing jeans and only loose long clothing. The temple is well worth visiting though if you’re in Kandy",2018/07/22,Anouska C,"London, United Kingdom"

Worth it at the top for a 360 degree view of Sri Lanka below and fantastic history. The frescoes are impressive and the place well worth the effort!,2018/07/21,874chantellew,"London, United Kingdom"
Visited today at around 4 pm started climbing sweted alot the entry points are lack of guide line sign boards but afterwards when u enter there are checkpoints around 43 in the end its view is breath taking.

"Visiting the Sigiriya Rock is definitely one of the highlights when touring Sri Lanka. The ancient capital city built on a rock as a fortress by a rebellious monarch has many fascinating stories from the past. The architecture and facilities cannot simply be comprehended considering the era that it was built, due to non availability of heavy machinery during that time. One side of the rock is yet to be explored and it is reported that excavations in new areas have commenced with new artifacts being unearthed. It was pleasing to note that new facilities have been introduced to visitors. It is recommended to be at the gate early morning to enjoy a leisurely and less crowded climb to the top.",2018/07/21,PandukaJ,"Colombo, Sri Lanka"
"i must warm! that my rating is unfair since i did not actually climb. What frustrated me even more is after driving through half a day from Colombo, my travel guide recommended me to not climb up the stairs as it was risky, over priced and difficult for kids.Outside view is not as spectacular as photos show. If you are planning your trip with young kids/aged parents you are spend time and money on other things. If you are young couple, and willing to spend some extra dollars than you may try it.",2018/07/21,Yogi-YSGM,"Cary, North Carolina"
"Well we spent little time at the fort during our visit. However, since we were vegetarians, we faced tremendous challenges to get decent food during lunch time. All we could get was sea food in most of the cafe's/ restaurants. Also, may be our guide was not so good, but could not identify any good things to do here. I guess this place is more for travelers looking to explore the fort by walking and learning the history. I have two young children and with them, did not find it very interesting. Honestly, could have skipped this as a part of my itinerary and would have not missed much. Also, beware that if you are pure vegetarian, not a lot of options to eat either inside the fort or outside. So, please prepare yourself for this.",2018/07/21,mbhandari_ind,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates"

"It was cold, wet & windy on windy, bumpy roads not well maintained. We arrived there about 8.00am to begin our nature walk. Ranjith didn’t tell us it was a 9km loop walk over many dangerous surfaces or suggest we take water. It rained the entire four hours, not heavily. It was 12km according to my Garmin. The weather conditions were horrific & dangerous for a 4 hour 12km hike. The surfaces were rocky, steep, uneven, constantly changing, wet & slippery. It was too misty to see much & our guide just walked off ahead most of the time. It was so slippery he slipped over near the start. It was a most difficult, never ending walk in shocking conditions & should have been cancelled. The one highlight was Bakers Falls which were spectacular and heaps of water falling. We met up with three lovely young Chinese girls who walked we us. We enjoyed chatting with them & they were far more considerate & helpful to me than our guide. One of them also slipped over. We are in our early 60s & fortunately both very fit. It was the most arduous walk which I thought with never end. We walked to Worlds end where there were meant to be spectacular views but all we saw was mist. There was a bit of a view at Little Worlds end. I couldn’t believe how often the terrain under foot changed. It was such a relief to finally finish at 12.30 pm. Definitely not to be done in wet conditions",2018/07/20,amcmilli,"Melbourne, Australia"

You have lovely little shops you can browse apart from.the usual Barefoot and Odel. There are several cafes you can take a chill break at. You can watch the sunset from the fort. Places for kids to have ice creams while you grab a drink.

"To be honest I was skeptical about going to Sigiriya. I only went because my friend wanted to see it. In the end, she was nursing a sick child, but I went ahead with my family and the remnants of hers. It was way better than I expected but I think that is because we decided to pay for a guide. The guide just added so much depth and colour to what we were seeing and helped us to really understand some the engineering marvels at the site. He also helped us to understand the steep entrance fees. The site is run by UNESCO not the Sri Lankan government and UNESCO set the fees to put towards heritage.Physically the climb is a challenge. We were advised to be there at 7am and we followed that advice and I'm so grateful we did. We finished at 9:30am and as we were descending there were queues of people on the staircase (it was a sunday). Whereas we ascended reasonably easily. I was amazed to see people there with children in backpacks or front packs. You would need to be fit to carry a child all the way up. As a 52 year old with a dodgy knee and bad foot I wore a knee brace which I was grateful for on the way down. The steps are not sized for big feet so you end up side stepping down from the monument. There are some tight spiral staircases which get windy so might be a challenge for anyone scared of heights.Overall, I thought it was great and it was great to learn some of the Sri Lankan history especially as I'd spent the rest of the holiday pretty much lazing about.",2018/07/19,tanyal816,"Melbourne, Australia"
"Much has been written about this fascinating World Heritage site and its worth reading what you can before you arrive. I need say no more. But two points for the relevant tourist or culture depts: I) the museum designed and built by the Japanese and kept very clean, needs repainting - with at least 250+ tourists visiting every day each paying $30, they can surely afford it; 2) there are a number of men, all polite and intending to be helpful, soliciting to be guides.

"We went to the sanctuary on a Monday morning and had a wonderful experience. We were literally the only people in the sanctuary aside from a couple workers cleaning the paths - it was very peaceful. We saw barking deer, monkeys, wild boars and heard and saw about a hundred bird species. The sanctuary is very well maintained. We spent about 3 hours there and think the money for entry was well worth it. You do not need a guide, although they may be able to provide explanation of the sanctuary’s history (we read about it before and after and found that was enough). The only thing to watch out for is the leeches. We only had an issue with this when trying to hike to the lookout (which in the end we couldn’t find - it may be overgrown by large trees now or we may have missed the trail as there are a few leading to the top). The leeches are quite small but easy to spot wriggling up your shoes. Spraying your shoes/feet and legs with insect repellent beforehand would solve this problem. It was also raining a little off and on while we were there so you may not have this issue on dry days.Enjoy the sanctuary and keep it as clean as it was when we visited!",2018/07/19,KellynJames999,"Perth, Australia"

However if you love nature and trek then one should go and history lovers would love the origin and the idea behind why King Kassappa choose to build a fortress here and the archaeological marvel and the scientific technology to get water around the fort and the rock is still in use.The fort is no longer there and is ruined however there is a legacy that will continue to live for times to come.There is a adjacent rock called the Pidurangala Rock and is also known for the trek and the climb.. so if you love it these places are a must to dig.Now for the young and the old who cannot trek for them, there are plenty of Tuk Tuk who would take your for a 45mins tp an hour trip around the Rock and show you all the view points and narrate you stories from the bygone era. so well it does cater to one and all.",2018/07/17,itsmearul,"Bangalore, India"

"I was not aware of the rich history of Sri Lanka until I visited. From the ancient in the cultural triangle to the colonial that starts in Galle, there is so much to see, learn and be amazed by.Galle is a wonderfully intact colonial fort dating back to the first efforts by European powers to capitalize on the spices of SL. The Portuguese started it, fortified by the Dutch and last held by the Brits. The result is a small city, still populated and lived in by locals hosting us tourists within its fortified walls. The hotels within are beautiful, the narrow alleys and streets full of good food, quality shopping abounds and there is plentiful art all around. One can stroll ALL the streets in a day, while stopping everywhere you find interesting. And believe me do stop, as you will find some gems (figuratively and literally). Hire a well trained guide to make the history come alive, it's about a 1 - 2 hour tour depending on how interested you are in the history. Walk the wall at sunset, being sure to find yourself on the southwest side before dusk, or you may find yourself without a seat.

The roof of which is Golden, and one cannot see the tooth as its well guarded and kept in a dagoba...which is in shape of the stupa.the temple as such is not much of a walk..so one should be able to cover in about an hour or less. but the entrace and parking are far and you may have to have a healthy walk. There is also a small museum of the King within the premise.",2018/07/17,itsmearul,"Bangalore, India"
"Hmmm, not quite what I was expecting. But interesting, in a way. If you're interested in Buddhism and what it means to seek the 'eternal emptiness' not sure this is the monastery for you. But if you're headed there to demonstrate your commitment and gain karma by gifting your tchotchkes or old European cars to a hoarders heaven, then bingo! you've hit the jackpot. As a result some interesting items are on display. Bonus -- there is a beautiful Bodhi tree on the grounds.

Husband and I visited this site in December. It is a must see attraction. It was the busy season so lines to climb up the rock were long and it was very crowded - lots of stairs.

"Filthy day but a lot of fun on the 8k hike through the plains. For a family of 4 it costs about 50quid at the gate. So be aware of that. Your driver will probably just want to wait in the car for 3-4 hours whilst you hike round. This is fine. You can’t get lost, it just goes around in a loop. Out hosts were adamant that you should go right to Baker’s Falls first. As it’s quieter and you should see more wildlife. We didn’t see much wildlife as it was blowing a gale, horizontal rains and fog all the way around. We were promised monkeys but saw none. There was no view as it was dense fog despite setting off hiking at 7am. My kids still loved it, we all got soaked but many people were worse off than us.

"This is well worth the time and effort for an amazing experience at the end of the climb. The crowds were thin on the day we climbed and that probably made it much easier than those who do during the busy months. I would suggest a guide who can explain everything that you see as this really enhances the experience and because things are not well sign posted. There are some very precarious stages and those with vertigo will enjoy a crash course in overcoming it. The wall paintings are good to see on the way up but the real delight is the view at the top. A word of caution, on the last few hundred stairs you ""will"" be offered help by ""guides"" laying in wait. I strongly recommend firmly declining as they will be asking large amounts of money for assisting you with the last few steps. The history and view make the effort well worthwhile.",2018/07/13,BusinessBear,"Sydney, Australia"

The view is amazing.The walk true the park is equally beautiful. In one hike we saw so many different vegitation going from tropical forest too grassfield that would remind us of the Scottish highlands. If the fogg wouldn't have cleared, this walk would be enough to make my trip to Horton plains worth it.The hike took us about 3 hours. When you enter the park you arrive at a crossroad.

"The temple is situated near Kandy lake & is considered as a most sacred Buddhist temple. Temple contains a sacred relic (Tooth) of Gautam Buddha, founder of Buddhism.Temple is nearly 4 centuries old & is Unesco heritage site. Temple is situated in a old fort & is well maintained. The sacred relic is not accessible for viewing as it is placed in a golden casket. Was told that Tooth is covered by 7 golden caskets each covering other casket. Once in 4 years casket is placed on the back of ceremonial elephant & taken out in procession. This is a most auspicious day for Buddhists & people stand in lines for days together for viewing the casket & praying. Sometimes line extends to more than 5 Kilometres.Everyday three times a day ceremonial drums are beaten in temple and casket can be viewed & prayers offered. Visitors must engage an official guide to view the temple if they want to enjoy the visit. This is a high security area as in 2008 bomb explosion had damaged outer wall.

"This is the best beach in the western part of Sri Lanka. You will find less of local crowd and more of foreigners and the beach is much used for snorkeling and scuba dive. There are lot of restaurants by the beach so buy the drink outside and you can enjoy the food having a drink at the beach side restaurants. Hikkaduwa beach has 2 bays- Hikkaduwa bay is small and less waves making it perfect for swimming and Narigama bay which is right next to it more towards the south. This is a spectacular surf beach. You get an amazing sunset viewing opportunity. The Hikkaduwa beach is a very scenic place and a gorgeous tropical beach. The color of the sky and the waves looks amazing and it is a pleasure to the eyes. It is not too crowded. Sea is like a warm bath. It is also clean and active beach and perfect for surfers because of its high waves. You get amazing beach parties at night, just ask around where the party is on a certain day since every day the party is at specific place.There are lots of restaurants and bar options, the sand was soft in most places (few spots of rock found in the water). However watch out for jelly fish, we had a couple of stings. Lots of tourists are found so you don't really need to cover up like in other town. You will find lot of people sun bathing on the clear white sand and almost clear blue waters.  It is well worth a trip and the beach is just like a normal holiday beach, water sports, and restaurants etc. When you get off the beach and into town there are many souvenir shops which are fun to browse, and tea stores as well. Best time to visit would be Jan and Feb and from here you can plan for Whale watching. Narigama is a much bigger/longer bay with more restaurants/hotels/activities and bigger waves making it better for surfing. Why don’t you visit Hikkaduwa beach?",2018/07/11,838titusd,Sri Lanka
"Horton Plains is a gently undulating highland plateau at 2,100.meters above sea level of Sri Lanka,lying at the south end of the central highlands. It is dominated by Kirigalpoththa (2.389 meters) to west and Totupolakanda (2,357 meters) to the north. Kirigalpoththa and Totupolakanda are the second and third highest mountains in Sri Lanaka. Tha charm of the plateau and encircling mountain range, often concealed mist, is enhanced by Baker's Falls and the two two escarpments, Small Worlds End (274 meters) and Big Worlds End (884 meters). The plateau is drained by tributaries of Mahaweli Ganga (main river of Sri Lanka) to the north (Agra Oya) and the Walawe Ganga to the south (Belihul Oya), serving as an important catchment area for these two rivers which have been harnessed for irrigation and hydro power. This plateau consists of many Amphibians, three types of harmless reptiles, birds and mammals including the leopard. Access to the plains are mainly from Ohiya, Pattipola and Nuwara Eliya. There are foot trails from Nagarak Trail is from the Agrapathana - Diyagama Tea Estate and also from Belihul Oya which falls into the same Nagarak Trail. This is place you must visit and possible to camp in the camping site. Plenty of Wildlife and ideal location for a wildlife photographer like me who is looking for adventure .",2018/07/11,Dhilip d,

"This national park has an amazing biodiversity of species and some incredible lakes, rocks and the sea. We had an incredible time with our two children but we overdid it by booking a full day safari departing at 4.30 am and returning at 7.30 pm. Exhausting. We had a great driver and managed to see a leopard taking a stroll along an enchanting lake. We had such a long time to observe elephants in the wild..it was amazing. Birdlife incredible and our son got very excited by the crocodiles. Unfortunately the park does not impose that official guides and rangers should be the only trained people taking tourists around the park. As a consequence, there is a mad rush to get your client as close as possible to the animals. In our case this resulted in a traffic jam of Jeep around a rather stressed male elephant who felt so threatened, he positioned himself to attack us...we had 5 minutes of total panick which luckily did not translate into tragedy. Incompetence and a lack of regulations are the reasons behind this. I hope the Yala National Park management will read this.

"We visited mid morning in time for the second session of the day. Entrance fee LKR1500 per person. My daughter (11yrs) free entry. Dress code was shoulders covered and legs to below the knee. It did not feel like a money grab. There is much to see and any funds are surely needed for upkeep. I strongly recommend hiring a guide so you understand what you are seeing and don't miss anything. Our driver recommended LKR1500 for the guide as reasonable - and I think it was. Perhaps agree the cost with your guide beforehand to avoid surprises. It did not seem compulsory to give small donations throughout except at the actual tooth casing viewing area (which was spectacular by the way), where worshippers gave LKR200 and so did we. It was wonderful to witness worshippers bring flower offerings and pray - especially the parents bringing their tiny babies for a blessing. It was crowded and a bit crazy, but this added to the atmosphere. There were areas where you could take respectful photos and areas clearly marked where you could not. This is not a place for selfies. My son (13) loved the architecture, carvings, colour and sounds. My daughter (11) found it quite overwhelming. This is such an important site, with an amazingly rich history. It's not a tourist attraction, it is a place of worship. If you don't bother to learn a bit about its significance or indeed the incredible history ahead of going, or if you don't like temples then don't go. Otherwise enjoy being immersed in the experience.",2018/07/11,Jane C,"Melbourne, Australia"
"This was my first Buddhist temple of many in Sri Lanka, and by far my favourite. The many depictions of Buddha, the education about the different monks, and the architecture was stunning. The many offerings and monks praying were interesting to see as well. Recommend wearing modest dress, and athletic shoes so you can keep your socks on while walking through the temple.",2018/07/11,marilyn c,"Kaiserslautern, Germany"

A great little walk to the top that wasn’t too scary for our 11 year old that was nervous about the height and also the wasps. None to be seen.

"We loved the park. It was a very good experience and unbeatable. We saw leopards, a big herd of Elephant, some beautiful and rare birds and much more. There are some beautiful small ponds inside the park full of lotus are one of the fascinating sites to look for. Our journey in the park started at 6 am, so we left our hotel at 5. Its not a lush green forest as this area gets less rainfall. In the middle of the journey we were taken to an amazing beach, Overall it was a good experience because we love forests, however since we are from India... there are much better and dense forest / wildlife to explore in India compared to SriLanka. Especially Leopards are found in abundance in India. Also in a forest without a Tiger you feel incomplete. Though we paid around $80 all inclusive (due to off season), I felt it was little steep.

"My 2 kids have a desire to walk into temples and sometimes say a prayer. We roll with it. I like it. This is why we ended up here. Firstly, as a foreigner, you line up somewhere else to pay a fortune, then again as a foreigner, you put your shoes in a different spot and pay another amount upon collection. We have been to many places of faith and I always think that if you are of that faith and are going to worship you shouldn't pay, regardless of where you come from. I think it is a cheek to charge an absolute fortune simply because you come from somewhere else.We went at about 11am. It was pretty busy but not crazy. I quite liked all the other parts more. If I could jump in a DeLorean, I would go back and say - Eve don't go - find a different one - you aren't missing much. Mind you, my kids liked it and that is why we went in the first place.",2018/07/10,Evearound,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"

"The grounds are huge and immaculately maintained, we had a guide guide us around as part of our tour, tickets are approx $30 each, and approx. 2000 visitors a day come to see this attraction making it the most popular tourist attraction in Sri Lanka. The guide was great in providing the background, history and outlining the significance of certain parts. It was quite windy on the way up. At the start there’s a 10minutes flat walk in and then there are steps in blocks of 7-10, one block followed by a walk and then another block, of you take it slowly it’s fine. Then at the foot of the lions rock (midway) there’s are another set of stairs which are more intense to get you to the top, these I found more strenuous, but as it was non stop as ppl are behind you, it felt harder. At the top there’s the kings swimming pool and some ruins but of more interest was a picturesque scenery of just luscious greenery, the view of the national parks was beautiful! The route down was very quick and fairly easy. As we got to the bottom our driver showed us a postcard of how the palace looked in it’s time and it made the whole experience a bit more real. As we descended, we had a refreshing king coconut and just mused at the little monkeys which were very cute! Worth a visit, try having a look at the postcards, take your time up (took us an hour in all) and enjoy!",2018/07/07,H_PatelLondon,London

There’s also a stuffed elephant here which lived 50 odd years and took part in the festivals many a times.

"The dutch fort built in Galle harbor is dating back to 18th century, and it was a modification of Portuguese fort built earlier. This is one of the few well preserved fortresses in Sri Lanka.Before entering the fort, it's good to check a map or an aerial view from Google maps to have an idea about the formation it. Check out the streets and ancient buildings which are still appear in their original look. More importantly, the inside of the fort is still in use by residents and government offices. Travelers can feel the 18th century style here.Start from the front end of the fort (where the clock tower is situated) and walk on the rampart. You can see a splendid view of Indian ocean. Come to the lighthouse and go down to the beach also. Total distance is about 2 km. Walking in the morning would be better. Even the afternoon is fine. Avoid noon. It's hot but due the breeze not a big issue.Galle museum, Sri Lanka maritime museum and Christian reformation church are the things you must see.There are plenty of restaurants and cafes inside the fort.

Part of the beach, called Narigama, is long and wide, great for swimming, the other part, Hikkaduwa beach, has a coral reef with great snorkeling and scuba diving opportunities. Also, because of coral reef shelter, this beach is suitable for swimming even during summer season when the sea gets really rough. My favorite part of Hikkaduwa, is that its not too commercialized but a cool place with parties and beautiful people from all over the world.

"This rock is located in northern Matale district near Dambulla town and i must say that this is one of the best attractions that Srilanka has to offer. It is historical and archaeological sight that is dominated by a massive column of rock nearly 200 meters high. The palace was built by the king kasyapa at the top of the rockThe capital and the royal palace was abandoned after the king's death. To reach at top you need to climb almost 1200 stairs and for that you should be in good health. It takes around 1 to 2 hrs of climb while having a lay over in middle of the rock, Morning time is recommended to climb as it will be cooler. Even if you don't climb it, the area below rock side is amazing for watching the lake and garden full of tourists. Further you can enjoy Jumbo safari ( elephant safari besides rock ) to get amazing photos with elephant and rock it self.

Galle Fort is a must-see attraction in Galle. It offers wonderful views of Galle town on one side and the sea on the other. It’s a short inclined walk but definitely worth doing. There’s plenty of space so you don’t feel hemmed in by tourists and it’s very relaxing just sitting with the sounds of the waves in the background. It is well-maintained with just a few small gift shops dotted around (no hassle from street traders).,2018/07/04,EconomynotBusiness,"Stanstead Abbotts, United Kingdom"
"I stayed in unawatuna and I found Galle the best city in the south. Not far from Unawatuna, it took me only 20 minutes by motorbike. I love this ancient city, full of nice shops, restaurants , jewellery stores and the walls of the fortress that lead to a typical Sri Lankan beach. I recommend this place, if you find yourself in the south of Sri Lanka, do not miss it.",2018/07/04,65eugenior,

Gangaramaya is one of the oldest Buddhist temples in Srilanka, its a big one and its beautiful. There is just so much to see and there's even a museum inside. Its mystical and magnificent and you will see Buddhist people parying to Lord Buddha and around the Bodhi tree and very accepting of all the tourists coming and going.

"Reverential buildings help us to understand and appreciate societies and their history. I know little of Buddhism save that it is a meditative, peaceful religion whose followers are not materialistic. Visiting the Gangaramaya Buddhist Temple leads one to question all one’s assumptions. The whole temple area is packed with possessions in glass cases for all to see. A rich abundance of barely organized rich junk: watches, jewelry, silver plate, chinaware, glassware ... even motor cars. There are also large transparent containers full of money. All this mid an abundance of gold iconic figures celebrated in the Buddhist pantheon. Outside, under the trees, one can find a little peace. Inside, your senses jangle under the weight of a vast miscellany of disparate objects. Is this wealth of leavings supposed to impress us with what worshippers have sacrificed? Why not sell them and give the money to the poor and needy? If not, why not donate the best to museums.

"ising 200 meters vertically from the flat pains, Sigiriya Rock provides you with one of the most dramatic sites in Sri Lanka. Top of this rock contains ruins of an ancient palace complex, built during the reign of King Kasyapa (477AD – 495 AD) and surrounding rock is the Royal Garden. It is one of the 7 world heritage sites in Sri Lanka and is one of it’s most popular tourist destinations.The Sigiriya site consists of a 200 meter tall granite rock, whose sides are so steep that at some points the top overhangs the base. Ruins of various chambers, stairways and pools can be seen at the top of this rock. There is a stone stairway leading from the base to the top of the mountain. About half way to the top, there is a giant pair of lions paws which is in fact are the remains of a huge head of a lion whose open mouth served as the entrance to the royal palace. Surrounding the palace complex are the ruins of a garden complex consisting of two moats and various pools, some with water fountains still functioning after 1500 years.",2018/07/02,Damecowalk,"Colombo, Sri Lanka"

"This is one place you have to visit if you visit Sri Lanka. 1202 steps up and 1202 steps down and built for the King many, many years ago. We did this tour as part of a group tour with Trip A Deal and it was well worth it. Lakmal, our guide, walked us up to the top of the rock and then down again, stopping to explain certain things along the way. It is a very interesting place…….you could just picture the daily goings on around the place all those years ago. We even had to stop and wait for the resident wasp colony to come out and “stretch their wings” half way up, before we could progress any further. The climb is a little challenging, but once at the top, it is well worth it as the views are fabulous with 360 degree panoramas. My the King led a great life back then!!",2018/07/02,Russell F,"Melbourne, Australia"

"Our driver organised our driver and jeep for us and he did a good job as our driver was great. We met him in the town after the 2 hour drive from Tangalle. We paid $100 USD for the 2 of us. It is about 13 km from the town of Yala to the park. At the beginning. The driver picked up the ticket from the office/museum area where we stopped. We got out and used the bathroom and had a look at the museum, which has a display of animals and bones. It is pretty tired looking and you would think with the number of people going through the park daily (about $10,000 USD per day) that they could make a bit more of an effort. Our driver Sandun from Sunil Safari was a great driver, confident, fast and trying hard for us to see a leopard and an elephant. We saw an elephant early in the peace. He just waited after all the other jeeps had gone and out of the bush towards us came a young bull. It was very cool. We got to then see a leopard up in a tree. Quite hard to get through the crowds of jeeps so you do need a driver who is somewhat assertive. We saw wild boar, deer, buffalo, bee eater birds, white throat Kingfisher, owls, Sri Lanka National Bird, crocodiles and so much more. The road is pretty pot holed so be prepared for a teeth chattering experience. It was a good full afternoon of racing around the park trying to spot animals etc.You have to get a good knowledgeable driver as that is what makes the difference between OK and great. It was a great experience and would do it again.",2018/07/02,AucklandWiz,"Auckland, New Zealand"

We gave an offering to the Monks and saw the urn that houses the Tooth relic. The ceremony was very interesting. You really need a guide as there is so much to see and learn about.

The entrance charge was 1500 LKR per person. With a tour guide the trip for two people would be around £25 or 5000 LKR (with the suggested donation).

You are considered to be very lucky if you could spot the leopard which is the most celebrated of all the animals in the park.

It was beautiful! I must highlight that proper attire is required and some days might be busier than others!

The tooth relic at this Temple is the only known tooth relic of the Lord Budha. The temple has a budhist museum that offers original and replica artificats from different regions of the world. Each country has a designated section highlighting their budhism heritage. It is a must visit. It is good to go to the temple at the time of the prayers.

I don't understand all the bad reviews here. This is a beautiful temple. We went during the evening prayers arriving at about 6.45. We had to pay an entrance fee of 1500 per person and a small fee to the person keeping our shoes (a facility only for international tourists)Our guide took us in and we joined a queue with the locals who wanted to get closer to the tooth. We waited until about 7.15 when they opened up the doors to see the tooth. The tooth is kept in a case so you don't see the actual tooth. For about 15 mins the doors to the other rooms are kept open. We went to the library room where we were blessed by one of the monks who gave us a white thread to the around our wrists.It makes a big difference to go with someone who can explain things to you. It's much more interesting.,2018/06/27,j1ggles,United Kingdom

Bentota is situated on the southern bank of the Bentota River mouth, at an elevation of 3 metres (9.8 ft) above the sea level. The name of the town is derived from a mythical story which claims a demon named 'Bem' ruled the tota or river bank.The beach is full of rowdy Sri Lankan resident frauds trying to sell goods to you and snatch away your money.

"We did an afternoon safari last week at Yala National Park. Were initially disappointed after visiting Minneriya National Park the week prior and absolutely loved it with lots of elephants up close and we observed these for ages, just so wonderful. Yala is a huge park, very dry with not a lot of vegetation for the wildlife to eat. We managed to see 1 elephant, deer, birds, 1 crocodile, wild boar, loads of buffalo, monkeys and then nearer to the end of our tour, jeeps went crazy as there was a sighting of a leopard. Our driver hunted the leopard down, was crazy driving with heaps of jeeps squeezing close to each other to see the leopard. We sighted the leopard and our driver was so happy, kept saying you see Madam, you see Madam, was a great moment but felt very sorry for the leopard. I think all the drivers just think you must see a leopard and don't worry too much about the other animals.

"There is a fees associated with this. For SAARC country members, the fee is LKR 2835 Ticket counter opens at about 7 amIts better you go with comfortable walking shoes. Advisable to go in the morning as soon as it opens as you will avoid the hot sun. Climbing up will be tedious and will be tiring. However, you will find all your tiredness goes away once you reach the top. You can plan to climb above the Lion's paw which is the real attraction. Carry comfortable ease to carry water bottles. You do not get any food or water or don't have any toilet facilities once you start climbing. Some monkeys around and hence if you are carrying some eatables, please be careful.You will see lots of stray dogs but harmless. You may want to engage a guide if you are really interested to get many details about this place which once was a fort/palace type. I did not engage as I felt happy just looking from the top and get a nice view of the complete city. On the way up and before lion's paw, you can see some paintings as well on the rock which is goodAfter returning, you will come across shops for eating or for purchasing of items like paintings, batik works etc., it was costly though being a tourist spot. You will have toilets there, good facility for car parkingMuseum is also there which you can cover either before or after climbing. I did after as i want to go to the top as soon as possible. Climbing up took about 1.45 hrs and down is about 1.15 mins. Though coming down was relatively easier, the challenge at some places is the type steps which you need to be carefulNot suitable for elders, who have issues in climbing up (close to 1200+ steps).",2018/06/25,Gokul A,"Chennai, India"

"Sri Dalada Maligawa or the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic is a Buddhist temple in the city of Kandy, Sri Lanka. It is located in the royal palace complex of the former Kingdom of Kandy, which houses the relic of the tooth of the Buddha. Since ancient times, the relic has played an important role in local politics because it is believed that whoever holds the relic holds the governance of the country. Kandy was the last capital of the Sri Lankan kings and is a World Heritage Site mainly due to the temple.Bhikkhus of the two chapters of Malwatte and Asgiriya conduct daily worship in the inner chamber of the temple. Rituals are performed three times daily: at dawn, at noon and in the evenings. On Wednesdays there is a symbolic bathing of the relic with an herbal preparation made from scented water and fragrant flowers called Nanumura Mangallaya. This holy water is believed to contain healing powers and is distributed among those present.The temple sustained damage from bombings by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998 but was fully restored each time.After the parinirvana of Gautama Buddha, the tooth relic was preserved in Kalinga and smuggled to the island by Princess Hemamali and her husband, Prince Dantha on the instructions of her father King Guhasiva. They landed in the island in Lankapattana during the reign of Sirimeghavanna of Anuradhapura (301-328) and handed over the tooth relic. The king enshrined it Meghagiri Vihara (present day Isurumuniya) in Anuradhapura. Safeguard of the relic was a responsibility of the monarch, therefore over the years the custodianship of relic became to symbolize the right to rule. Therefore, reigning monarchs built the tooth relic temples quite close to their royal residences, as was the case during the times of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, Kingdom of Polonnaruwa, and Kingdom of Dambadeniya. During the era of the Kingdom of Gampola, the relic was housed in Niyamgampaya Vihara. It is reported in the messenger poems such as Hamsa, Gira, and Selalihini that the temple of tooth relic was situated within the city of Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte when the Kingdom of Kotte was established there.During the reign of Dharmapala of Kotte, the relic was kept hidden in Delgamuwa Vihara, Ratnapura, in a grinding stone.It was brought to Kandy by Hiripitiye Diyawadana Rala and Devanagala Rathnalankara Thera. King Vimaladharmasuriya I built a two-storey building to deposit the tooth relic and the building is now gone. In 1603 when the Portuguese invaded Kandy, it was carried to Meda Mahanuwara in Dumbara. It was recovered in the time of Rajasinha II and it has been reported that he reinstate the original building or has built a new temple. The present day temple of the tooth was built by Vira Narendra Sinha. The octagonal Paththirippuwa and moat was added during the reign of Sri Vikrama Rajasinha. The royal architect Devendra Moolacharya is credited with building the Paththirippuwa. Originally it was used by the king for recreational activities and later it was offered to the tooth relic, it now houses the temple's library.The temple has been attacked on two occasions, in 1989 by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna and then in 1998 by the militant organization Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.Do engage a guide who can explain about each tree, colorful paintings on walls and roof and about different statutes and development of temple over the years. Only thing that is important is men cannot go inside with short pants and women in legs or arms exposing attire.

"We visited this site as a day trip from Negombo.On arrival, we eventually found the ‘foreigners’ ticket booth which was a little out of the way. The price was $30 per person, which was in my opinion, very steep for a historic site for walking up.Upon arrival and all the way to the entrance some 400 meters from the car park, we had locals trying to offer us a “tour guide experience” for $20 extra, claiming that we would miss “special routes”. Rest assured, we walked up and down and explored at our own leisure with ease. We also made it back to the ‘foreigner exit’ which was strategically plagued with locals who were hassling us to purchase their items...There were dogs all around, which were seriously ill and in a bad way, which seemed to have been spray painted in purple... I asked around but nobody seemed to know, one that could barely walk tried following us and unfortunately lost its balance and fell off a cliff edge... pretty distressing.Overall, the views of the historic site are fantastic, it is well looked after and great for an hour or so hike. I think it would be particularly uncomfortable however in high season as it was full of large groups when we were there, meaning queuing to walk up stairs in high humidity, pretty uncomfortable. Also, make sure you take water with you as there is nothing beyond the entrance.

Were were taken her by our tour guide as the last thing to do before our flight back to the UK. Such a beautiful place and a wide range of collection of items including a large collection of Buddist statues. It certainly felt very spiritul and peaceful. We had a blessing from a monk and were given bracelets and wished a long and happy life which we felt was the perfect nd to our time in Sri Lanka. I know some reviws have mentioned about money (donation) but this is really no different to other religious places of worship.,2018/06/23,nellynora,"St Helens, United Kingdom"
"This was part of our round trip of Sri Lanka and when looking at the rock from one side it looked like a breeze. I have an absolute fear of heights but from the view I had at the bottom I thought I’d be ok.The spiral staircase up to the cave paintings was extreme for me but was great to see. Not looking down at any point I felt so pleased that I had climbed up and then believed that that was that. However, when you turn the next corner you see what is lying await in front of you .I was there and wanted to climb the rest but I was petrified. However with the help of a guide and shear determination I looked at the rock and I did it! It is really worth it as the views are stunning and the scale of the ruins above are magnificent. I would have been really annoyed with myself if I did not go to the top.I would not recommend getting a guide but to be honest had this guide not helped me from the lions foot to the top I’m not sure if I would have managed.A proud moment and definitely worth it.",2018/06/22,Alcofrolic,"Glasgow, United Kingdom"

Quit a nice area to walk around explore all the little Resteraunts and Cafes and watch the Sea. Pretty unique architecture for Asia. Worths a visit!,2018/06/22,Tim R,
It is so full of history and quaint buildings ! A must see is the Maritime museum - it takes a hour + to do justice to this well laid out museum. We loved the mosque built in Dutch style ! The churches were very Interesting too. It is possible to hire a tuk-tuk to drive around - but the real feel and essence comes from walking around ! You probably need a day to explore fully. Perhaps stay In a hotel in Galle Fort City.,2018/06/22,mgs2702,"Mumbai, India"

Located on the Kandy lake and very easy to get to, go and have a look around this amazing building!  Shoes must be taken of before entering and I had to cover my legs but I did notice some males were wearing shorts so maybe certain tourist got away with it.",2018/06/22,kaneLeicester,leicester
"This is a tough climb, especially when you go up the steel flight of steps. Don't look down. Once you reach the top, you can see for miles. The view is unbelievable. The history of this rock is amazing. Just take your time there are over 1000 steps, but so worth the effort. Just a tip once you pass the part were you have your ticket checked, there are men waiting for tourists to guide you and help you go up the steps. They want foreign currency for a tip which I did not have as I left any thing valuable in the car, the guide was not happy with rupees and I was yelled at and told the rupee is rubbish. Otherwise any one can do it.",2018/06/21,Cheryl L,"Broulee, Australia"

"The park itself is stunning, I’ve visited many all over the world and never seen anything like that. The red sand, the beach, the lush green, it’s all just amazing. The problem is there’s no control over the guides and drivers and most of them have no respect for the wild animals. They speed, they shout and rush in groups of 10-15 jeeps when see any and ambush elephants and leopards with no sense of danger or care. If you love animals you’ll leave the park feeling very let down. That’s not the way to do it! The public is paying to help destroying their environment!",2018/06/21,stephanie_miranda,"Madrid, Spain"

"The coral reef glass boat ride was an ad-hoc proposal by our local guide as a short activity during our Galle-to-Bentota ride. June is not the best season for sailing far out to areas of better diversity because of the current but we were able to see quite a good variety of marine life including sea turtle on the shallower reef side. There are a few people snorkelling so you can probably see the same things without paying for the ride. However note the sea can get quite choppy, combine that with shallow waters and rocky bottoms, a boat ride is not a bad option if you are interested to see the reef.",2018/06/20,106christie,"Hong Kong, China"
Great area with the center of attraction being the lion rock.. Definitely worth the long strenuous climb.. Good views of the expanse at every level of the climb.

"Our guide suggested we got up early and went while it was cooler, which was a great idea, as even at 7am it was still very warm!

I mean, many travel to Sigiriya to see this site.The view from the top is lovely and the climb down relaxing. A note: my 80 year old mother decided to give it a miss and took my two year old back to the hotel. The result was that my spouse and I enjoyed the visit much more. May not be suitable for the elderly and very young.",2018/06/20,Orchid_fever,Asia

"I should start by saying I think we must have chosen the busiest day of the year to visit here as we were in Sigiriya over a festival. The place was heaving the and queues were so long we didn’t even get to go up the rock! Whilst there were signs saying due to volume of traffic you may not make it up we had wrongly assumed that this we was a standard warning, but after waiting 20 minutes in the queue and moving about 10 meters we decided it wasn’t worth it. Luckily the park is lovely and there are places that you can walk around and we still managed to get some good view points of the rock but it would have taken us hours to get to the top. Pidurangala rock is much better as quieter and cheaper, but it is probably still worth a visit.",2018/06/19,nicolaj848,"Loughborough, United Kingdom"
"Awesome view from the top, Its crowded during public holidays but still was worth the hike! Ticket counters close at 5 PM, so its best if you go in morning or in the evening around 3 PM.

Prepare to walk and hike more than 1000 steps to the top of this UNESCO world heritage site. Amazing to see thousand years ago the king has built his palace sound this big rock and make many of his sergeant to carry him up and down ! A steep climb up and you need lots of leg power to hike and beware of the new hornets that may come to bite you as many tourist there to disturb the bee with loud noise . A good day walk out but as foreigner you need to pay USD30 per entry per pax. May need to hire a resident guide to tell you a story when hike to make sense !,2018/06/19,agoh69,"Singapore, Singapore"
It might be the best known place in Sri Lanka - but its still fantastic!A great climb up via steps and ladders .............. do try and get there early when its less busy - as the ladders get especially busy - and it can be hot later in the day!The view is terrific - as is the work of UNESCO,2018/06/19,StephenGX,Gerrards Cross
"This may be an unpopular opinion, but I’d suggest backpackers skip this rock altogether for budget’s sake. It’s just not worth the cost. The entrance fee is $30usd, so roughly 4,700 rupees at the time of our visit. This gave us entrance to the grounds, rock summit, and museum. We found the cost highly inflated compared to the actual experience. While it’s interesting to be on a large rock overlooking the surrounding countryside, and the frescos were beautiful, it wasn’t one of those places that enhances a trip, or makes it a memory worth a lifetime. The Taj Mahal and Angkor Wat had similar entrance fees but their infamy and the spectacles they offer allow for such prices. This rock was interesting at most, and the ruins at the top were unspectacular. It’s true that this sight is incredibly old, and many might find that alone a reason to visit. For half the price, we would have left feeling like our time and money was well spent. But the inflated entrance fee compared to what we experienced left us wishing we’d skipped it all and climbed the other rock overlooking the famous one, for a fraction of the price. The museum was especially drab and not very informative or well lit. Again, it depends on individual interests and price points. But for the average backpacker looking to do something interesting, come to Sigiriya for the view and small town, which is cool, but skip visiting the rock itself. I don’t believe you’ll leave regretting your decision.",2018/06/19,shannonlee353,"Taichung, Taiwan"

"The Sigiyira Rock has an intriguing history. The ruins of the fortress atop the Rock and the water garden below leave visitors to ponder the elegant architectural style of this country's ancient civilisation. Climbing the Rock(esp. When it's windy) is quite a thrilling experience itself. The attached museum is also worth a visit both for the background info it provides and also for appreciating the museum's design, though it's refurbishment is rather minimal. The Sigiyira Rock is rather difficult to reach by public transport hence the journey is easier with a car and driver. We greatly enjoyed our 5 day driving tour which started from Colombo -> Nuwara Eliya (2 nights) > Kandy(1night) - > Dambulla - > Polonnaruwa -> Sigiria (1 night) Sigiria Rock -> Airport. Our schedule is a bit tight, luckily our guide/driver (facebook: San Aravinda. Tel/whatsapp: +94 766132787) gave us advice about where to stop and how to make the intinerary more reasonable according to his understanding of the sights and traffic condition etc. We were able to enjoy such a variety of scenary in five days (hilly tea plantations, mysterious mountains / falls, colonial hotels/parks/clubs, elegant Sinhalese lakeside town of Kandy, paddy fields, numerous manmade lakes, glamorous temple of the tooth relic, the cave temple at Dambulla, the magnificent ruins of Pollonaruwa and the most enchanting Sigiria Rock) and feasted on local fruits (avocado, durians, papaya, mango, king coconut, pineapple etc) and bought lots of spices along the lazy and winding country road. And we even saw wild elephants by the roadside. Through our driver, we also learned a lot about Sri Lankan life/religion/politics (and even visited his family) which enriched our knowledge of the country and its people. Though it was a tight itinerary, thanks to our driver we enjoyed it in a relaxed way. We highly recommend him.",2018/06/18,Fanny W,

"My experience to climb Sigiriya Lion Rock was extremely good. The place surrounding the rock is also breathtaking, they said that June is an off-season month, but it was crowded with locals and internationals. I guess the ticket is overpriced!",2018/06/17,703shafeeqa,
"My daughter and I climbed this today. We went around 8:30am on a Sunday, and there were small queues going up and big ones going down. But the views were spectacular and the ruins made us wonder how on earth they got all the building materials up there. As suggested in the title, I’m not fit and both my daughter and I got colds a couple of days ago, but we still managed to get up and down in 2½ hours with plenty of rests. There was quite a breeze, which kept things bearable. There are a couple of trees at the top, but there isn’t much shade.",2018/06/17,YorkshireJumbo,"Tadcaster, United Kingdom"

"There are couple of things i want to point about this National park. I would like divide the my fellow traveler in two sections -Prices1. Cost for Safari jeep is 120 USD , if you bargain they will give for 115 USD. This cost includes the national park entry fees along with water bottle and safari jeep.2. You can get the Jeep from your hotel as well as from the help of your cab driver if you have hired any.Make sure when you book through your hotel you ask whether the price includes national park entry fees. Hotel should charge 18000 LK but in my case our cab driver was smart he arranged from outside in 115 USD , the safari jeep driver was very quick while taking us to the right spot at right time .Experience -It is being said that when day is yours you are the king . Same thing happened with me , it was off season in June 2018 when i went to Yala . I had very little hope to see anything except spotted dears (as those are common ones which you can easily spot !).To my surprise i saw all the animals that are there in the national park starting with Single elephant , Crocodile , Bear, Wild Pigs , Elephant family then finally i saw Leopard. That was the moment of joy. The Leopard was visible for close to 10 mins, crossed the road in front me .So what are my takes from this visit1. Hire a full jeep for yourself , even you are two people . You might get tempt ot have more peopel in your jeep so that your jeep cost is shared but my experience says hire the entire jeep for yourself.2. Go in off season , that will have more chances to spot Leopard as off season means less people in the national park",2018/06/17,Shivam P,
"The Dutch Fort of Galle in Southern Sri Lanka is a World Heritage site with many great attractions. For me, the greatest attraction is the Fort Wall (Ramparts) and the fascinating Indian Ocean below and beyond it! Apart from this there are architectural marvels such as the old Dutch hospital, numerous houses, government buildings etc dating back to the same era. The light house is a major attraction, too. Many of the houses and other small buildings are now converted to the numerous shops and restaurants, of course, without harming the original architecture and the theme. This place is immensely popular among the international tourists for obvious reasons. I would not hesitate to state that Galle Fort alone is an adequate reason for someone with a taste for historical places to pay a visit to the island nation Sri Lanka. There's something for everyone in the family here. Kids can play in the beautiful sloping grassland. Teenagers can play a game of cricket if they know how to play the game. They can also take long strolls up and down the sloping walkways on the ramparts and spend quality time. Young adults can jog along the long tracks. However, in my opinion, just sitting and gazing at the immense Indian Ocean from a good vantage point on the ramparts is a superb way to spend quality time as well. Early morning and evening are the best times to be here. Perhaps, one should do a morning round and then return in the evening as well. Moonlit evenings here would make you wonder if you are on earth or in heaven! If you get hungry anytime, there are some fantastic restaurants to help you. The old Dutch hospital which is now converted to a shopping area has several great restaurants such as Minute by Tuk Tuk upstairs. If you sit at the seaside corner you can enjoy amazing views of the ocean while enjoying a delicious meal. There are many resorts and homestays inside the Fort that provides decent accommodation. The narrow streets on the land side of the Fort (opposite the ramparts) has many interesting shops selling various stuff, mainly handicrafts, gems etc. There are some great restaurants and ice cream vendors as well along these alleyways. Be mindful when you walk on these roads as people, bicycles, motor cycles, trishaws and vehicles have to share the same road. However, unlike in many other parts of Sri Lanka, co-existence seems to work very well here. If you have a choice visit the Galle Fort during the time of world famous Galle Literary Festival. Though there will be so much congestion and people touching shoulders you will not regret as evening to night there is so much happening including cultural shows under mesmerizing displays lighting etc. You would feel as if the whole world is here in Galle with tourists from all over the world gathering at Galle Fort during this time.",2018/06/17,dammikad,"Nugegoda, Sri Lanka"

"If you look at photos of this place in guidebooks, you could be mistaken to believe that the walkways up this magnificent rock are planks of wood and ropes - they are NOT! They are all either stone steps or firm metal walkways with good handrails. That said, I wouldn’t be keen to let small children run free. We are a relatively unfit couple in our 50s and we were up and down in about 1.5 hours without difficulty.The experience is amazing. The views are magnificent.TIP. Set off early to avoid crowds and heat. We were in the car park by 8.30 which was about right.You don’t have much option but to experience the whole route as there isn’t anywhere to divert to on the way. There is a spiral staircase half-way up which takes you up (and back down) to see some amazing frescoes. The last bit is also pretty easy from the lions claws up to the summit. There are some amusing signs en-route!",2018/06/16,Peter H,"Leeds, United Kingdom"

This climb was one of the highlights of my trip! Make sure you get there around 730am at the latest so you are climbing before it gets too hot. The climb takes about 30-45 mins on the way up (depending on your pace) and only 15 to get down. It is a mix of stone and metal steps which are not too uneven. You don’t need to cover your shoulders or anything which is excellent as it was a very sweaty climb!! Would highly recommend when you are in Sigiriya.,2018/06/15,Bec S,
Sri Lanka is a Country of steps and this site ie the daddy of them all. Due to our age we only made it to the Lions Paw and that was some achievement. Great scenery from above the plains. The only drawback was the pushing and shoving from the thousand other trying to do the climb also. The Museum at the beginning was also worthwhile.,2018/06/15,GeorgeTill,"Arundel, Australia"
"The views are amazing and well worth the 5 stars but the tracks around the area are more likely a 2 and in places very challenging and it appears that in June/July there are a lot of wash-aways which means you need to climb over boulders or walk in amongst what looks like stream beds. Do make sure that you get there early in the morning. We had to wait at little worlds end for the mist to lift but the wait was well worth it for the view and then another challenging walk to Worlds End for even more amazing views. Toilets were really poor with broken doors, broken cisterns that made them almost unusable. A lot of the steps in the area were also badly washed away which is where the challenge comes into it.",2018/06/15,Grant M,

Ticket includes visit to temple and museums and SAARC nationals get discounted tickets so make sure to carry your passport along. Recommend to go during prayer time (picture with details).

The whole place is very peaceful, there are a number of shrines all of which are open to the public. One I would recommend is on the ground floor behind where the tooth chamber extends to. This has a series of placards with the story of the tooth in it. I would recommend this place to others to visit",2018/06/15,jonoutandabout,"Greater London, United Kingdom"
Its supposedly 2000 odd steps...But honestly we didnt find it that tough.Its about a half a km walk to the Rock from the Parking area with a small musuem area at the entry point where u purchase tickets. SAARC Country passport holders get a 50% discount on the Adult ticket -- so we paid 15USD each. Child ticket is anyways 15USD. The actual climb is steps all the way to the top with one break area in between where u can rest. The top is a large area and has panoramic views of the entire region with Green forest cover and smaller peaks of the hilly region around. The Rock is clean and well managed. We spent about 3 hours from start to finish.Small street shopping area at the Foreigners Car Park at the exit where u can buy refreshments. It was a good climb and a nice experience. My 10 and 14yr olds did it easily. Anyone with reasonable fitness will not have trouble reaching the top.,2018/06/14,rvpmumbai,"Mumbai, India"

"Tips for tour guide: If you want to know about everything there from entrance to the first step of the rock and after that to the top of that, it costs only 1500 Rs.

Take a bottled water because there is not any water tap, but, after coming down there is an another route to exit which you can find supermarkets and also souvenir shops.We have been there in off season and it was very quiet, also, no problem for kids and older people.

"We were there during the Sri Lankan New Year holiday period and so we got somewhat of an understanding of what it means to the Sri Lankan people to use this holiday time to take their time out to go to religious sites - this being an epic one for them.When you're shoulder to shoulder in incredible temperatures stepping forward slowly but surely together to THE room in the temple where we discovered there was nothing to ""see"" but it was a place to ""feel"" so much closer to whom you are worshipping and indeed the Sri Lankan people were doing this en masse. Plus they were doing it SO respectfully to one another and the tourists among them who really had no idea what they were feeling but at least were trying to understand.We're very glad we visited for the entire experience and to visit this landmark building.The Buddhist museum here is also very insightful, informative and educational although frustrating that you are not permitted to take pictures for these purposes.",2018/06/14,ALittleRobynToldMe,"Invercargill, New Zealand"

This is a must do attraction when in the Sigiriya area.There is a wonderful story attached to the history of this monolith and the countryside and climb are certainly worth the climb (it's not too arduous if you have a reasonable level of fitness).

Galle fort can definitely be one of your pit spots on your visit to sri lanka. The walk along the fort walls is quite pleasant and spreads across a huge area.

Lots of quaint little cafes / restaurants around. Its an enjoyable experience and definitely recommended.,2018/06/13,mamtashroff,"Mumbai, India"

We were lucky to see a leopard and a sloth bear, which from what we later heard was such a rare treat. There are many many jeeps all driving around madly so it is essential that you choose a reputable operator. There is also lots of other animals to view in the 'wild', i.e. elephants, monkeys, crocs, bird life, but all in all the total experience was certainly worth the effort.",2018/06/12,Jinkster22,"Melbourne, Australia"

The park is extensive and we spent more than 3 hours there, following elephants, deer, water buffalo, mongoose, chameleon, Sri Lankan monkeys and a variety of birds, including a pair of sea eagles and the painted stork. The journey was confortable, due to the expertise of the driver. We did not see any of the 35 leopards in the park, but saw their favourite tree. Our guide had seen one the previous day and friends saw two the next day. I loved being able to get so close to wildlife we do not see in Australia yet know they were living in their own habitat.

This landmark is definitely worth the visit. The climb up is very good and safe. Approx 1200 steps but it didn't seem too bad.

"After travelling extensively across Sri Lanka, I went ti Sirigiya rock and I think you can't skip it if visiting the country. It's an impressive site.We stayed in a hotel nearby and around 8am, we headed to the site.There's a 15min walk from the parking and if you haven't got water, make sure you grab some bottles. Once you pass ticket control and cross the stream, you can view the gardens. Bear in mind that from this point, you'll go up in steep steps for an hour or over. Used to travel with my elderly parents, I realised that some may not find it easy to reach the summit. It'll depend on your fitness level. There's a long iron staircase that will take you to the beautiful frescoes. And then rock steps with helpful iron rails that will take you to the summit. Up there, the views are just stunning and worthy every sweat of climbing with such hot and humid condition. We were lucky that it wasn't sunny yet windy so it aided the climb.The little remains of the construction left are a proof of how majestic the site was. The lion paws, beautiful gardens and pool are breathtaking.

"I arranged a tuk-tuk with my homestay in Haputale to go here very early one mid-week morning. This cost 2500lkr, as the drive is over an hour and the tuk-tuk driver waited for 3hrs (return trip). Entrance to the park is expensive, probably too expensive, but there is no way of avoiding this. However, the circular 9km hike once you're within the park is very rewarding. The path is fairly challenging as there are a range of terrains, from sandy red coloured rocky river-bed style paths, narrow paths with 4000ft drops at one side, and flat ordinary trails along the plains. There is much wildlife to see, as well as the views. As for the plains, they looked not unlike the Yorkshire Dales in England, except with Rhododendron bushes! This area was a refreshing change of terrain from the endless yet beautiful hill views which are common in the area. Make sure you get there between 06:00 - 07:00 am to get the most out of the views. Cloud cover usually lifts at this time, then falls again a few hour later. Despite this, the views are only part of the experience.

We spent some enjoyable time watching family groups of elephants, some crocodiles and a variety of bird life.

We did not see either of the preferred animals but if we had I am sure we would have thought it more worth while.",2018/06/10,kathyk0l,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia"

But you could wander around checking out all the streets in it and the shops and trying the food for several hours I imagine. The jewelry shops in here are quite overpriced. The prices in Colombo are much better. The only jewelry place we found that we liked the actual stones because they were good quality was called Mineral. They were overpriced but still good quality. The other places, the quality was not that great and the prices were just ridiculous.

"Reading about this temple is why I decided to visit Sri Lanka. But it was really quite a let down, especially when you compare it to other temples. There’s three floors, with small shrines as you go up, before reaching the main part. We felt quite awkward walking through the middle of people and families sat on the floor praying, like they were on show and not being given respectful privacy. If you struggle walking barefoot, do take some socks as the ground was quite hot outside the temple. Where you leave your shoes to the entrance of the temple is a little way on hot stone. As we came out there was a little office that had dvds to explain the temple. They were free but we didn’t see them advertised it was just that our guide knew about them. Don’t miss the little bookshop, this was lovely with books on Buddhism, the tooth temple and other surround temples. There is also a very small gift stall. Not too sure I’d recommend this, especially over other temples. If I had to pick one it would be the golden cave temple. The temple is also quite expensive.",2018/06/10,tuppence88,"Crawley, United Kingdom"

"If you’re looking to holiday in a tropical paradise, Mirissa just might be the answer to your dreams: swaying coconut palms, beautiful golden sand beaches, days spent rocking away in a hammock. It doesn’t get much better than this. This crescent-shaped piece of paradise is famous for having the most stunning sunsets and sunrises in Sri Lanka. There are no luxury resorts to mar the landscape, so it’s just you, the beach, and quiet during the day. The pace picks up at night.

"The terms “beauty” and “beast” usually go together well, except at Polonnaruwa where beauty goes better with “ruins.” The second oldest kingdom in Sri Lanka, Polonnaruwa is known for the ruins of this ancient garden city. The 12th century ruins are some of the best preserved in the country. Polonnaruwa was a place where traders of exotic goods mingled with worshippers in the many temples. Start your tour of Polonnaruwa at the Archaeological Museum, then proceed to the massive (50 buildings) Royal Palace with its well-preserved audience hall.

This ancient city is built on a steep slope, topped by a plateau almost 180 meters (600 feet) high. This plateau is known as Lion’s Rock as it oversees the jungles below. Access to the site is through staircases and rooms emanating from the lion’s mouth. You’ll also see ponds, gardens and fountains. Pretty cool! Locals consider the site the eighth wonder of the world.

"Top 10 sites to see in Sri Lanka
It has only been in recent years that Sri Lanka has opened up to general tourism.

The civil war that ravaged the country for decades had kept people away but the situation in the country has improved dramatically since the conflict ended in 2009.

The effects can still be felt today, though. There’s no danger or fighting anymore. It’s more about what’s missing.

While other countries in Asia were expanding their tourism offerings, Sri Lanka was making virtually no investment for the 26 years of the war, between 1983 and 2009.

It means that, coming to Sri Lanka, you’ll find that there isn’t the tourism infrastructure that you would find in Thailand or India.

It also means that you may not know where to start with your travel planning. You haven’t heard stories from friends and family for years about all the best places to visit and things to do.

If you are like I was before my first trip, maybe you don’t really know anything about what there is to see in Sri Lanka!

Well, I’ve been to the country a couple of times now and so wanted to put together this guide for you about the best things to see.

Think of it as your basic entry-level information about some of the main sites and regions that you’ll want to visit on your first trip to Sri Lanka.

Hopefully this helps you get a bit of an understanding about what the country has to offer. I have marked the ten places that I’ll tell you about on this map so you’ll have a visual reference to help.

There are 157 statues in total and they were first installed in the 12th century. It’s quite an eerie feeling to stand inside the caves and have them all watching you.

One of the area's nicest hotels with an incredible landscape is Jetwing Lake.
And if you want a treat at a relaxing retreat, you won't find better than Kalundewa Retreat.
Sigiriya Rock Fortress
The most famous site in the Cultural Triangle is Sigiriya. It is a fortress that was built on the top of an enormous rock about 1500 years ago. Around the base of the rock was a large city and the ruins are still here.

There’s an interesting story behind Sigiriya. It was built by a man who killed his father, who was the king, and then stole the throne from his older brother.

He was so scared of revenge that he made the new capital at the top of the rock so he would be more protected.

Visiting Sigiriya, Sri Lanka

You can take the stairs and paths up to the very top of Sigiriya and it’s an impressive site. Along the way, you’ll see different parts of the ancient capital city and some impressive art in a cave on the cliff.",2018/06/10,Michael Turtle,
"As well as culture, Sri Lanka has a lot of natural wonders to offer. I’ll be talking about a few natural sights in this guide but I think the most impressive one is seeing the herds of elephants in the wild.

Elephants are an important part of Sri Lankan culture and you will probably come across some that are chained somehow. That’s why it’s so refreshing to see them in their natural habitat, in large groups, usually with a few babies amongst them.

If you're looking for budget options, Fresco Lion Villa Hostel is a really cool place but a bit out of town. And Sigiriya Hostel has a much better location.

A wonderful but affordable four-star option that I would recommend is the Cinnamon Lodge Habarana.
And for an absolutely stunning hotel, you can't go past Jetwing Vil Uyana with special bungalows.

And if you feel like treating yourself, Ekho Lake House is a really beautiful place.
Kandy
South of the Cultural Triangle and higher up into the mountains is the city of Kandy – the largest outside of the capital region.

It has a charming feel to it, despite the busy streets, with a mountain vibe and a thriving cultural centre.

The most important site in Kandy is, without doubt, the Temple of the Tooth (officially called Sri Dalada Maligawa). It is an important pilgrimage site because it is said to house a very special relic – a tooth of Buddha that was brought to the island in the 4th century.

The temple was certainly a critical location for the spread of Buddhism from India to Sri Lanka. There are several ceremonies each day when the building fills with locals bringing offerings",2018/06/10,Michael Turtle,
We were on our honeymoon and we stayed at Sigiriya. Early in the morning our driver took us to the base and we purchased the tickets . For SAARC countries there is also a discount as well. So people belonging to SAARC to countries can also avail this discount. It is recommended to climb the rock in the morning time as the weather is a little pleasant .Before the climb do take some water and if possible chocolates etc as well.Form the near by market we bought up some pineapples as well. The view from the top is too beautiful . And its totally safe to climb up there are a lot of spots where one can rest up.,2018/06/09,hamzas313,
"It is worthwhile to visit, but do it before or after the school trips or else you will be shuffling forward a foot at a time with 10,000 others. Half way up I couldn't believe that I had paid to waste my time to move VERY slowly up the rock. But when we FINALLY reached the top, I thought it was a very impressive view and monumental achievement to have built a palace/fortress on this rock.",2018/06/09,harry w,"Burlington, Canada"
"This rocky outcrop topped with palace ruins is a unique and special Sri Lankan attraction. The most important detail I can offer is how to fit this in to your travel schedule. If you are heading north from the hills (Ella, Haputale etc.) take the train from there to Kandy, then the bus to Dambulla, then change there to another bus to Sigiriya. This is a time-consuming journey, so stay at a hotel in Sigiriya for the night. In the morning, visit the Sigiriya site in the morning for about three hours. Afterwards, take a local bus from Sigiriya southwards to Inamaluwa and get another local bus from there north to Trincomalee. The local bus network in Sri Lanka is extensive and they generally run approx. every 30mins.",2018/06/09,AndyB186306,"Hemel Hempstead, United Kingdom"
"This was a beautiful site to see. I’m glad we went on an overcast day or it would have been extremely hot. Still, wear a hat and take water with you. I can’t say how many steps as everyone says a different number and I didn’t count them. It was a great leg workout. Enjoy, definitely a site to see.",2018/06/09,876pamd,"Long Island, New York"
We had a wonderful trip to Yala. We did a morning trip which started at 6am for 3hrs and an afternoon which started at 3.30pm. In the morning you definitely need to get there super early to avoid the queues. No later than 5.30am I would suggest. Afternoon is a lot quieter but can still be quite busy.

"After two weeks in nice nature parks, mountains, ancient cities and tea plantations it is an old but nice town which reflects nicely the Dutch history of SriLanka:Nice walks, old and historical houses, the fort itself, beautiful sunset and good restaurants and hotels within the fort. It turns meanwhile to a tourist place with shops accordingly but still very friendly people. It is just nice walking the streets up and down, having a cup of tea or espresso and feel the atmosphere.",2018/06/09,Adlkofer,"Pfaffenhofen an der Ilm, Germany"
"I'm not sure how often this ceremony takes place (perhaps every night), but we arrived at 7:00 pm to view the reliquary containing one of the most sacred relics in the Buddhist world. It is quite spectacular with a long line of viewers filing past while drums and cornets played constantly. Apparently Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles are the only non-Buddhists to have seen the tooth itself.",2018/06/09,harry w,"Burlington, Canada"
"It was a rainy day when we were here, thinking maybe we won’t go in, walking barefoot we could slip and fall. We decided to go for it, we’ve come all this way.

"We visited the rock from Kandy on a day trip, took about 2.5 hours to get there, and paid for tickets on the door, was 4770 rupees.We were advised to try and climb before 0930 but due to the journey arrived late. We actually found the rush had died down and at one point (11AM) we were one of about 6 people on the top! Which was great for photos.The climb is fine, possibly a little hairy for those scared of heights, but stairs the whole way. Not particularly physical with 3 places to stop on the way if required.The site of the old kings quarters itself is much larger than I expected and great to view. The associated sites at the bottom are equally interesting and multiple.We spent around 4 hours here. Would say it is a must do for Sri Lanka!",2018/06/08,jacobf869,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom"
"This is an absolute must-see if you are in the area of Sri Lanka. Climbing up a lot of stairs can be tricky in the heat, and it can be exceptionally busy (especially on religious holidays). Higher up the rock, the metal stairway nailed into the rock looks like it cannot hold the endless stream of people. The views from the top are absolutely stunning and worth the climb.",2018/06/08,harkinchris,"Dumbarton, United Kingdom"

All went in diffrent direction but from time to time the traffic was really congested and the diesel fumes was dence around the cars ... Not really an experience of naturen!,2018/06/08,OlleBengtsson,"Vastra Frolunda, Sweden"
"We opted to take a local guide up for the tour. Usually we are sceptical of using these but knew from friends that there is a lack of information on the way round; and at 600 Rupees it’s not much - but agree your price first!Really interesting temple, with a number of buildings and museums. Thanks to the guide we saw and entered some rooms I would have thought we couldn’t, although some areas felt rushed so he could get his next customer. We spent around 3 hours across the complex.We queued to walk past the tooth case with others giving offerings, which is worth it for the closer view.Dress code is strict so make sure knees and shoulders are covered.",2018/06/08,jacobf869,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom"
"Visiting another of Sri Lanka's amazing temples. Only criticism is the temple can get very busy, occasionally people rush past you. Although you remove your shoes to enter every temple (to be respectful) there were some wet/sticky areas of ground. Be aware of the flower sellers who ask you to hold their flowers but will expect you to buy/donate.",2018/06/08,harkinchris,"Dumbarton, United Kingdom"

"I live relatively close to Mt.Lavinia and have visited this beach so many times. If your passing or staying close to Mt. Lavinia, you should definitely visit this beach. There are lots of restaurants on the beach and it's very crowded during weekends. Very less crowd if your doing a early morning beach walk (7am-8am). It's literally impossible to find parking space during weekend evenings so better park our vehicle somewhere on Hotel road and walk to the beach. You need to cross the railway tracks to get to the beach so better watch out for trains specially if you have kids. I don't recommend any one to actually swim as usually the seas are rough.",2018/06/07,Umesh P,"Colombo, Sri Lanka"
It was my second time to Galle after a five year gap and it felt like the first time to me. The European-sque pretty fort area with quaint shops will charm you.

"We went whale watching from here, which was great. We also witnessed the fish market, which was full of sights, sounds, smells. Amazing. Hordes of people buying and selling fish. Lots of beautiful boats.",2018/06/07,Nancy P,"Pine, Arizona"
Lot of tourists but the complex is large and so you don't feel the crowd. Please don't wear shorts or cut sleeves - its insulting and banned. The history behind the temple makes it worth a special visit. Beautiful statues and paintings inside. We hired a guide. Total visit time is about 1 hour or max 2. Plenty of stores right outside and the beautiful Kandy lake adjacent makes it a nice area to walk around. The Temple itself is clean and pretty.,2018/06/07,rvpmumbai,"Mumbai, India"
"Really nice place, so I had a great expectations. But religion is not money only. I didnt like  too many guides for money. Too many people, too many guides and prices was quit expensive oppositte other temples.",2018/06/07,romanv484,"Prague, Czech Republic"
Huge place where monks were taking oaths. Have a historic story of the tooth left by Buddhas . Sacred place to worship,2018/06/07,Roopali A,
"We didnt know what to expect as it was the first time in a Buddhist temple. Our guide told us many interesting things which made us appreciate the place more, else we would have been lost. The visit should happen first thing in the morning as otherwise is gets REALLY crowded. For people who are claustrophobic / elderly, going right in to view the tooth can prove to be quite suffocating",2018/06/07,SushiandSandals,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates"
Wonderful experience. We were at sigirya lions rock at 7 am. That was a good decision as there are many stairs to climb. It is however worth every step you take.

Got here around 8.30am and it wasnt very busy as if it was I could imagine why people have rated it lower than myself.Our guide walked us into the gardens which are really impressive by today's standards. Followed the paths which are simple to navigate up to the first few steps and had a moment where I thought we wouldn't make it to the top.Carried on taking in the views on the way with the breeze that made it a bit more bearable to come continue.The amount of labour and materials that were needed to build this makes me wonder how they did?

"one of the greatest lessons i learnt in life was here, and that was not to climb a rock in the afternoon. its probably common sense, but sometime you windup there without realizing the time. The heat does not help. So go in the morning or after 4pm before the ticket counters close. We went at 2pm and regret it.

"A well organized place to learn everything about Sri Lanka history. It starts with pre-historic era and continue with periods where Sri Lanka changed the Kingdoms. Information is truly valuable and interesting, not only for Sri Lankans, but also for foreigners. Because, the evidences for foreign trade and religious connections are shown.In a separate chamber, the throne and crown of last Sri Lankan king is displayed. Last used by King Sri Vikrama Rajasinghe.You need to spend at least 3 hours to cover the museum. If you can another 1.5 to 2 hours, there's to another separate section called National Museum of Natural History. It contains the natural history evolution in the country. Contains information on geological changes, fossils, bio diversity, pre-historic animals of Sri Lanka.The newly built section shows the ancient engineering marvel of Sri Lanka. The structure of great stupa ""Jethawanarama"", irrigation engineering wisdom ""Bisokotuwa"" technology of lakes, Pre-historic high quality Steel manufacturing technology. This stall is produced and authenticated by the Institution of Engineers Sri Lanka.You can't have snacks inside the museum. There's a cafeteria but it's very small. Video not allowed. Photography allowed only for personal usage. Keep in mind that, most of the ancient statues displayed in the museum are of Lord Buddha and Hindu deities. Therefore, we should pay respect and do not take photographs standing in-front of them. Read all the information (given in Sinhala, Tamil and English).

"We did a evening safari here while visiting the Thaulle Resort Spa nearby. We were most fortunate to see a leopard kill its prey and then a hair raising battle between the leopard and a crocodile over the kill. It was heart stopping to see the leopard drag the prey away Along with the crocodile. In addition, we got to see an elephant having a mud bath in the wild. We also got the chance to meet the star of the jungle, an elephant called Gamuno who came charging at the safari jeeps looking for food and thrust her trunk right into the jeep in front of us. Lots of elephants, deer, crocodile in addition to the colourful birds were also spotted. The prize of the trip however was the leopard kill and the subsequent fight with the crocodile. Something that even the seasoned tourist guides and staff back at our hotel say no one has ever seen in the past 15 years. We feel so lucky. Worth the trip if you like the excitement of the jungle and wild life.",2018/06/03,Ryan D,

"Everyone told us the best chance of seeing Worlds End (a view from the top of a cliff edge looking down into the valley of a small town which is picturesque) was to go very early in the morning. We were so tired from climbing Adam peak the following day and having no sleep we opted for a longer lay in so only got to Norton Plains as 7.45am. Saying that the weather that day wasn’t the best but it least it was dry. The 9km walk though was lovely. We basically had the whole park to ourselves (we saw maybe 20 people during our visit) and it was picturesque, beautifully quiet and the local wildlife were so used to people that they would come over to you or at least not run away when you approached.So did we get to see Worlds End? Unfortunately not, but whether we got up really early and chanced it or did what we did I think the chances for that day was limited due to the time of year. What I will say though is it didn’t take away the enjoyment we had of walking around the route, seeing the wildlife and experiencing the quietness. You will need to hire a driver and a jeep to get there as the roads aren’t great but most hotels will do that for you.",2018/06/02,p4m4,"London, United Kingdom"

Your hotel will meet syly be around 45 minutes away from the forest. Preferably start by 4am from your hotel so that you will enter the forest by 6am and will encounter more animals.By the time we entered it was almost 8am. We did not see any leopard for which this park is mostly known for. But we saw elephant from a.much closer distance.

"I recommend going to Yala in off season because there are only about 30 jeeps in the park compared to the 150 in high season. The park in the early morning light is magical. I loved how the safari park borders the wild coastline. I'd never seen such raw, undulating coast. There were beautiful elephants that looked so happy, boars, colorful birds, massive crocodiles, deer, bears and leopards. Sadly, we didn't get lucky enough to see a leopard but our driver was super determined and showed us many gorgeous things. We booked our driver through our accommodation at Richard's Cabanas and he was the best driver.",2018/06/01,Angela C,
"We did safaris, an afternoon and a dawn, and both were great and different by design. The afternoon safari was about driving though the more open areas and seeing as many animals and as much countryside as possible - and we saw heaps. It was a very impressive safari. We had a herd of elephants cross the road right in front of our vehicle and large number of other birds and wildlife. I got some great shots and there were so many animals at some points that you have to make decisions around where to point the camera first.For the dawn safari we made a decision to go looking for leopards as we didn't see any on the afternoon safari. Our driver took us into a very different part of the park where the bush was much thicker but had some known leopard resting spots. We drove around for a few hours through some beautiful country side and saw a lot of wildlife but unfortunately no leopards. We finally had to give up the search but on the way out we got to see a sloth bear - awesome.Highly recommended, I would have been happy just doing safaris for a week.",2018/06/01,Saggital,"Brisbane, Australia"

"We can imagine attackers trying to breach the magnificent thick sloping walls, lookouts in lonely bartizans, and responses of defenders. The old Portuguese Galle fort, built mostly of palm trees and mud, and later extended, was conquered by the Dutch in 1640 who brought their cannon to higher ground and aimed fire into the fort. The most dramatic ramparts of the stronger and newer stone and coral Dutch/British-built fort are on the ocean side, but there is no record of their fort being attacked from sea, or from land, and even the 2004 tsunami did not breach it. A better-restored fort and environs with changing of the guard, old cannon, Sunday night fireworks, and authentic chambers would offer an opportunity to attract more paying visitors. But now visitors can enter free and still get an idea of the size of the Dutch/British fort at its height in the 1850s before the British center of influence gravitated from Galle to Colombo. Our favorite walks around the fort are on the two levels facing the sea and atop the wall leading to the lighthouse.",2018/05/30,Staidthere,"Jakarta, Indonesia"

"Ok, if you really can't swing $30USD then go to the rock. But if you can swing it, then pay it. You can go on a tour, or go by yourself and just read up on it. TOUR: We did not do this. Just realize that you are climbing up a lot of stairs and you may or may not want to do this with 30 other people. I personally did not, so we went just the two of us. NON-TOUR: This whole area is absolutely huge. We spent 2.5 hours there. In truth you could likely spend a whole day trekking around. There is just a ton of boulder rock, off the beaten path hiking and trailing, etc. It's an amazingly gorgeous historic site.THE HISTORY: You need to look this up before going to really appreciate this palace/fortress. This thing existed sooo long ago and yet when you look at the gardens from the top, it reminds you of some of the most pristine places of today. Gardens as a concept isn't that old mind you. TIME OF DAY TO GO: Try to go first thing in the morning. If you're coming from Kandy via local bus, this means you take the first bus out at 6am or hire a guy to drive you there. There is little cover climbing to the top, so the cooler temperature of the early morning is ideal. WHAT TO WEAR/BRING: You need to bring extra water. This place isn't over run yet with people selling food and water. You'll want to carry a bit with you. Also, I would bring some food in case, like me, you run out of steam at the top. I was pretty jet-lagged, dehydrated and hot and the hike was nearly too much for me as I haven't been training as usual. The benefit of hiring a car is that you can keep your cover-up clothing for the Dambula temple there instead of lugging it with you up this crazy cliff. Also, wear hiking shoes. there are pretty great steps to climb up, but it's just nice if you decide to go off path. There were a few more advanced hikes that could be done. You have too look for them a bit. Also, bring a change of clothes. We were pretty disgusting after this. I would have been so excited to change into a different Tshirt. I mean I was truly gross and we were not even at the hottest season or time of day. SOOO worth it though. It's gorgeous and amazing. The views are unbelievable.",2018/05/29,Mll351,"New York City, New York"

"This was well worth the effort as the views from the top of Sigiriya Rock are incredible! It was very hot and so lots of water and a hat are a must. There were lots of tourists at the rock and so the sooner you go up the better (and you would probably avoid most of the heat of the day which can be tough when climbing so many steps!). There are places to stop along the way up and some of our group only did part of the climb; however if you are feeling up to it then it is worth going all the way to the top, especially to see some of the historical ruins as well as the views.",2018/05/28,4Sophie4,"London, United Kingdom"

We saw a guy go over on his ankle (it’s quite rocky in places) and really struggle. Be very careful when you get to the World’s End viewing points. Lots of people perch on the edge doing yoga poses but it’s very dangerous. The wind can whip up from nowhere and someone has died there.

It took me to the rock, waited for me and also took me to several other places of interest in the vicinity for briefer stops. Paid 2,000 rupees for about 6 hours of tuktuk time.The ticket gate is about 300 – 400 metres from the rock, but it’s a pleasant walk through leafy gardens with ruins here and there. The climb proved easier than I expected. Well-built walkways and stairs with railings made a big difference. However, this section has virtually no shade, so you need sun block and a hat.The view from the top was wonderful, but once again, there’s hardly any shade to rest under.Some advice: you need good shoes that still give you grip when the rock steps are wet. Carry everything you need on your body; you need your hands to be free on the steeper parts. Allow extra time to explore and enjoy the gardens below the rock.At around the halfway mark near the Lions' Paws, wasps can be seen buzzing around. There are signs that indicate that they can swarm dangerously at times, in which case the upper half of the rock will be closed and no refund given. No much anyone can do about that; but it would be a bummer.I didn't hire any guide. I overheard two of them as I ascended, and frankly, I thought they were giving a fake spiel about kings and citadels. From what I have read, archaeological consensus is that this place was a large religious hermitage, and has never been a centre of political or military power.Oh yes, as another reviewer mentioned, the frescoes are the one disappointment. Go to Dambulla Caves instead for better examples.Entry was an expensive 4770 rupees (US$30).",2018/05/25,F8714PN_Alex_W,"Singapore, Singapore"

"I was at the beginning of April at this beautiful stone fortress, a rock wich has on his top the remains of one of the early middle age capitals of the Sri Lankan state. To go on the top is an exhausting but nice experience in which you have to climb a lot of stairs. On the first level, on the vertical wall, you will find the famous maiden frescoes from the harem of the e emperor. You will climb again helicoidal stairs and you will arrive on the feet of the lion! There you can rest a bit and after the last assault to the top of the Rock, to the ruins of the ancient capital Sigiriya. It's a breathless image!",2018/05/24,Liviu S,"Brasov, Romania"
We visited at 7am when the park opens. Already very hot when we got to the top. Not for those with a fear of heights or not fit enough for the climb.

Just don’t expect to see the tooth.",2018/05/24,aindi,"mumbai, india"

"The 200 m rock looms in a beautiful setting of what must have been exquisite gardens and palace complexes. There are apparently 1500 stairs to climb with different intervals to stop, catch your breath and admire the scenery. This is a must visit site in Sri Lanka. The entry fees are a little steep for foreigners, moderate for nationals from SAARC countries. Ensure that you carry your passport if you are not a Sri Lankan. Best time to visit would be between 8-10 am or from 15:30 hours onwards. The sun and heat would be very high during the day. Ensure bottled water, hydration and good hats/umbrellas, walking/hiking shoes and loose, comfortable wear, preferrably with long trouser/leg covering.

"I loved this experience. The views from the top made the walk up worthwhile. If you make the trek up you won’t be disappointed. A few words of advice before you go... Get there for 9am, before it gets very busy! It is very expensive, the most expensive attraction we saw in Sri Lanka. Therefore I strongly suggest that you get a guide, there’s no use going up without someone to tell you about it all, otherwise it’s just a big rock. A guide will give you the history of the place and make it more interesting. The feat of engineering required to create the citadel deserves an explanation.Be mindful for the signs at various points that ask you not to take photos. Be respectful, and you won’t run into any problems.If you are afraid of heights (like I am) just be aware of it and prepare yourself mentally beforehand. I am ever so glad I made the effort.There are massive wasps nests near the top. Be quiet and know that if they swarm, you will not be allowed to make the last trek to the top. The stairs are slippery. Wear shoes with a strong grip. If you do this, you will be rewarded with a view which is amazing. Loved it!",2018/05/22,tonig763,

"I was in Mirissa on 15,16 May 18. While sitting at the cafe by the beach we could see a crocodile swiming behind the breakers less than 10 metres from the shore. It was there for the full afternoon and then it was seen again the next day in the same area swimming back and forth behind the breakers. Locals told me this was the first time they had ever seen a croc at Mirissa and government officials had been notified. The Coast Guard HQ is down the road and one would hope they would be monitoring the situation. The crocodile was a large adult possibly saltwater croc measuring up to 3 metres. I didnt realise that crocodiles live in the area and did some research. It turns out this is crocodile country. They have croc tours in a river system nearby. Coming from Australia this set off alarms bells and I couldnt bring myself to enter far into the water. In Australia where crocodiles live the messaging is strong that no water way is safe. Is it dangerous? I am not sure. People swim there every day and I didnt find any reports of attacks at Mirissa. It was perhaps a rare once off that the animal had ventured from its usual territory due to flood waters. It had rained alot in that period.However, I think it is important to note and be aware that this is a habitat of crocodiles.So you can make your own decision on whether to swim or not. There is no signage at all to announce that it is a possible danger. When I was there the lifeguard never mentioned this or even stopped people from swimming. It was other tourists that alerted swimmers. I am not trying to scare anyone from swimming at Mirissa I simply want to make people aware of this possible danger because there is no signage at the beach or messaging in tourist information.",2018/05/22,Fiona85,"Brisbane, Australia"

"I was blown away to see how in a small place you have such a confluence of religions and such a peaceful collaboration. I found this an example for the whole universal history where the conflict of different religious beliefs gave us so many other grievances and conflicts. I wish the Sri Lanka people could have again their King and strong leader setting the direction of this beautiful land. If you visit this place you will see the recovery done to the whole building, b namely the roof top. You have to leave your shoes at the entrance and walk bare foot as a matter of respect. The entrance fee is USD10/adult. Women should have shoulders well covered. Covers are provided upon paying a fee at the entrance.So make sure you bring flowers with you (buy at the reception) as you are entitled to a wish once you offer them to Budha. You should place the flowers with both hands and ensure you arrange the colors so it looks even more beautiful after your flower offerings. The place is magical, beautiful and you will see pilgrims that came just to meditate and pray.There are many areas to visit and in August there a big festival with almost 10 elephants. You can check all ornaments and customers used by the priests and invited VIP guests that are allowed to participate. You can visit the archeological museum but you need someone to explain the meaning of what is in this exhibition. You can see also the place where the King of Sri Lanka gave the land to the British.

1. Time to visit: early morning or past 16:00. You will take at around 1:45 to 2:00 visiting. Bring an umbrella if you come at other times a hat and some cold (iced) water. You pay USD30 as an entrance fee.2. What to expect: a beautiful scenery with lots of remains from what was a sumptuous Palace. 3. Street vendors: avoid interaction and the souvenir shops too. 4. Climbing the rock: you have two sections once you arrive you climb up to the base of the rock and then from there up to the top. First you will be going up using spiral stairs to see frescos only. Following that the real climb starts. Midway you have a stop before climbing the summit my advice is to keep pace and make of the stops to look at the scenery and rest. This specially important if you do it 11:00-15:00.5. Last comments: it has been more than 10 years since I visit this location. The increase in the entrance cost is not outpaced by the preservation one would expect. I believe Sri Lanka should be proud on maintaining the place and the amount of people necessary to ensure a pleasant visit. Too often I saw too many staff sitting and doing nothing. These people should be instructed to help guiding not only climbing the rock by telling the stories or eventually at the museum explaining a bit of the history. I also hope the increase in income from visiting is not used just to create another job but a meaningful and productive jobs that help Sri Lanka people being proud of the culture and work as ambassadors rather than just clerks.,2018/05/20,Jose F,"Macau, China"

Make sure that you are dressed appropriately (as with all the temples in Sri Lanka) - ie cover your legs and shoulders and be ready to take off your shoes (at all the temples we made sure we took little ankle socks with us to put on when we removed our shoes so that it was more comfortable to walk). At other temples we popped our shoes in our back packs, but here our guide insisted we had to hand them in (for a small charge). The temple itself was wonderful, the colours, the smells, the buddas - all fantastic. We purchased a small plate of flowers to place on the alter where several people were praying. The flowers were so pretty and colourful. We waited to see the monks arrive and knock on the door to be let in to where the tooth was, which was an interesting little ceremony. There were lots of other monks visiting and, as I say, people praying which added to the whole experience.

"A visit to Sri Lanka has to include a visit to this rock. Make sure to visit the museum first to get to understand the history behind the buildings, and see the replica’s of the paintings. We are a pretty fit family with correct walking gear (runners) and so didnt have a problem getting to the top. It is a lot of steps so bare in mind if not too fit. Take it slow and breathe correctly (altitude). Take lots of water, and be mindful of the other climbers. There is a stop half way so you can have a good break if needed. The spiral stair case leads up and down to the pictures (copies at museum). If scared of heights/vertigo this was the only really challenging part, the rest was doable. The view at the top is amazing, and with a map (from museum) you can place all the buildings. Side note, mobile reception was excellent, WhatsApp worked well to Africa. Enjoy. We went over NY and it wasnt too busy. Lots of locals dont go all the way up.",2018/05/15,meganwQ1477MQ,
"As a family of 5 we managed climbing in just over an hour. Well worth the visit, the children enjoyed it and amazing views from the top.

I would highly recommend getting there as early as possible.",2018/05/15,QldKell,QLD
"Hiking in Horton Plains is fun and enjoyable. Photographers will also find this place an excellent place to take photos of various landscapes and animals. The terrain changes significantly from open hills to rocky paths, mossy forests and water falls. The weather can also change at any time from sunny and warm to foggy and cool. The length of the trail is 8 Km which can be hiked in 3 hours, but can take much more than that if stops are to be taken.",2018/05/15,Derick A,

"I don't even know where to start. We came to Mirissa after Tangelle (beautiful beach) and we're expecting a few nice bars and restaurants. What we found was that 2 days before our arrival the government had come and bulldozed down all the illegal ones (which happened to be most of them). There was mounds of rubbish and rubble everywhere. After speaking to locals - who were happy about this by the way - they said they had a huge problem with 'beach boys' harassing girls and if you Google it there was a brutal attack on some tourists just 1 month ago. To be honest on this whole trip I (a 25 year old Bristol girl), this was the first time I felt genuinely uncomfortable and on edge by the many young men standing around and leering. On top of this there was a huge crocodile in the ocean! We found out after another tourist came yelling at us whilst we were swimming and sure enough when we got out there it was - it was huge. What makes this terrible is the fact that the whole time we were there not 1 local warned anyone about it. It was up to myself, my partner and other tourists to warn new people on the beach. The locals actually avoided telling anyone for fear of it hurting their business and customers walking away. Unfortunately I would have to say avoid this part of Sri Lanka. The rest is beautiful!",2018/05/15,Hannah8831,

". Sigiriya, a UNESCO world heritage site, is an ancient Lion rock, built in the fifth century. We hired a guide and it was a good thing we did. Its history in itself is very fascinating. The king who built this rock, took immense efforts and shaped its entrance to a lion who is about to leap on its prey. Hence the name Sigiriya; Si, or Sinha which means a lion and giri, means a mountain. Unfortunately all that is remaining now is the lion paws, at the bottom of the rock. The gardens and the swimming pools at the base of the rock mountain were lovely and well maintained. The climb to the top is exactly 1202 steps. And the views are simply stunning. We can view Sri Lanka’a cultural triangle from here; Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Dambulla.",2018/05/13,320supriyaa,"Edgware, United Kingdom"

This is an ancient city going back to 5 century A.M. showing the lifestyle of a ruler and genius of the architect. For me more impressive than Pompeii in Europe. Do not miss it. Visit in the morning or in the late afternoon to avoid midday heat.,2018/05/13,30Stella,"Bratislava, Slovakia"

We were able to take our time having stops along the way to have a look at the water gardens, the cave and enjoy the many many viewing areas.

"Initially we were decidedly sceptical about putting going to Horton's Plains. There was not one, but many reasons for that. To go to Horton’s Plains one has to start early. In fact, as early as 5AM and for that we would have to wake up at least at 4AM. Not to mention the unbearable cold outside. On top of that, Horton plains had a lot of mixed reviews about the walks and the views it offered. All that too for a extravagant entrance fees. We were struggling with the thought of waking up that early and going out in the cold on a long walk where the possibility of views being completely blocked by the clouds was high. But then on the other hand, we did wish to go ahead with the plan, given that we had come all the way along.At the end, we did go there. After a drive of an hour and a half, we reached the entrance where we booked the tickets, and paid the cab entrance fees. Even at that time, the place was overly crowded with tourists and their vehicles. A heavy fog was around. We thought we were prepared for the cold. As suggested by a few blogs, I was wearing 5 layers of warm clothing. We got off the cab and went to join the long queue for the entrance tickets. The cold was unbearable and soon we were shivering. Thankfully the tickets were finally sorted out and we got back in the cab, to drive towards the entrance gate. The fog had slowly started to clear up as we started with the walk. It was a three hour closed trail, a simple trek with a little up and down slopes and a little rocky patches here and there. Nothing scary. The fog is basically created by cloud forests in the Horton’s plains. Luckily enough, the sun popped out of the clouds, clearing up the fog. The Baker’s falls offered a pretty view. We got clear, unhindered views form World’s end view point. What Luck! But then, the views were actually not that impressive. And the walk was not that challenging. I would like to mention one impressive thing about the management of Horton plains. At the entrance, they have a baggage check point where no tourist is allowed to proceed with a piece of plastic, may it be a bag or a bottle or a chewing gum box, thus keeping Horton plains plastic free. I think this is a very sensible step and ideally should be followed everywhere around the world.",2018/05/13,320supriyaa,"Edgware, United Kingdom"
"Go there early, as early as you can, to beat the mist. Wear comfortable footwear and your bottles of water cannot be covered with paper.It's a lot of walking, climbing and will require you to be moderately fit. We did the whole shebang including the falls, and that took us about 3 hours. Once you arrive, you have two options, either to continue straight or go left, we went left. Our guide said we should reach the little and big world's ends before 9:30 so the mist doesn't settle in and he was right. If we had been 15 minutes late, we wouldn't have seen anything. The mist covered the whole area 5 minutes after we were done taking pictures. It was beautiful to see the cloudy body follow us and then cover us as we continued trekking throughout the planes.

"We went at 2:00PM, guide said it's the best time to avoid queues (and it's true) Advice to all : -Do not carry anything that smells like food/fruits/flowers in your bag Mr. Gemunu (Elephant) is aggressive and has unfortunately been fed a few times that now he stops jeeps for food.- Do not look elephants straight in the eye and do not panic if they come close (or smell you) that will just aggravate them- Whatever happens, DO NOT LEAVE THE JEEP, unless told to do so. - Do not eat prior to trip, it'll get really bumpy and you'll certainly feel nauseated - I don't recommend you bring kids to this, and if you do, I would tell the driver to make sure you don't get close to Gemunu Advise to the Safari: When you spot a leopard, only contact other drivers once your guests are done taking pictures - You should try to limit the number of jeeps around. It really isn't fun for any of us when 10 cars are stuck in one tiny road - noise pollution and the crowded feeling is unnerving A limit should be implemented on how many Jeeps are in the safari at any given time.The roads are really bumpy - Tour guide said it's because it's all natural and untouched by humans, but it's still scary when the car goes to 45 degrees throughout half the tripOn the plus side, we were very lucky to see elephants, a leopard, water buffalo, peacocks and many other wild animals. It was a great experience, I got away with selfies with Gemunu sniffing me and taking my friend's purse to destroy it. We had a nice scare and a good laugh, it is certainly a memorable trip.

Nice temple which has lots of interesting history. We visited when they do the morning prayer at 930am and it was packed. Add the heat with this and it can get a little much if you’re a shade locator like myself lol. Some bits you can’t take pics but they are clear signs where. You do get hustled about a bit but that is because people are going there for prayer and specifically for offerings to the Buddha tooth. We didn’t bother queueing to do the offering to the tooth as the queue was gigantic but could see it from through the doorway. Worth a visit.,2018/05/12,Jezza_K9,

"A great opportunity to enjoy the splendor of nature and spend the day actively!Wake up early, obligatory comfortable shoes,headcover, protective cream, sunglasses and drinking water. If you arrive early, you need a jacket, in the morning in early May it was cool.Before entering the territory of the reserve, a ticket office with a queue for 10 - 20 minutes. We were with a personal guide who took care of entrance tickets but you can go by yourself (get lost if you do not turn off the way is impossible). There is a parking before the start of the route, where both the touristic and personal cars park. There is also a cafe that looks rather suspicious, but our guide said that it is possible to have a tea and eat traditional pastries. It was not bad!The toilet is located at the back of the cafe, it is better to visit it, because there are no more lavatories on the entire route.Despite the clouds during the entire walk and a fairly cool temperature in the morning in the first 2 hours, the noses and cheeks burned, so you must always apply a protective cream, then a walk of at least 9 km will be comfortable and enjoyable.The road in places is sometimes rather stony and difficult, therefore it is better to choose another occupation for children and people with limited motor abilities.The nature is amazing, the silence, the singing of birds and the murmur of water in streams, passing into small rivers and waterfalls are interrupted only by groups of passing tourists. Early in the morning saw one deer and several roe deer grazing not so far from the cafe. On the way there were chameleons and earthen small lizards, many birds. We did not hurry, we admired the surrounding nature for a long time, and after 6 hours we completed the ring of the route.A nice rest for everyone who is going to Horton Plains!",2018/05/11,Victoria T,Стокгольм

"I have nothing to compare with.... no other safaris except on the TV!Here is a recount of my 4 safaris at Yala.We stayed at Cinnamon Wild. Our driver-guide met us at 05:30 on the first morning (yes, that early! Forget breakfast, you'll be back in time for that!) and took us to meet out jeep driver in the car park. We were the driven to an admin area near the part of he park that is open to the public. There were lots of other jeeps there ----maybe 40 of them. BEWARE: the toilets are some of the worst!At 06:00 the jeeps are allowed to enter the park. They all belt along the rutted roads. The jeep driver is supposed to point out animals and impart information. (See my post on Dickshon Safaris to find out more about our awful experiences in the jeeps and the overturned one that caused injuries)The first safari ended about 08:30 and we were back in time for a 09:00 breakfast. Animals seen: water buffalo, cormorant, crocodiles, Axis deer, ibis, peafowl, fishing eagle, bee-eater, jungle fowl, boar, monitor and dung beetle.The second safari started at 15:15. We drove along different tracks, many of them severely rutted. Bad back anyone? It's a no-no!Animals seen: elephants, open-billed storks, hornbills, Brahminy kites, little egret, Eurasian spoonbillThe third safari: bad news! My wife's back was killing her so she slept in. I set off at 05:30 and had a different driver ----my driver-guide had helpfully complained about yesterdays. This was the driver's boss. He should have been good. All I got from him was 'Python' and 'Crocodile' ----no infoformation. He was as bad as the other driver!Suddenly, his phone goes, he pulls up and then hurtles off down tracks. We turned a corner and there in front of us was an overturned jeep. There were two Australian passengers, one injured, a badly injured (Is he still alive? I don't know!) driver-guide and the jeep driver. I spent the rest of my third safari doing my best to help the victims and going with them back to their hotel, the local Jetwing. Hope they're all okay!Animals seen: a mongoose, pythonThe afternoon safari was on time! Amazing! There was no mention of the morning. My driver ignored me.We visited a memorial site for the tsunami which hit the coast in 2004. It killed so many people. Sad.Animals seen: lesser adjutant, brown hawk owl, kingfisherWe spent ages over the 4 safaris tring to view leopards. If one jeep driver spots one, all the other jeeps are contacted and then they all arrive near, for example, a water hole. Many engines are kept going, jeeps jostle for position ----it is not good!I told my jeep driver (through my guide) that I was not fussed abouot leopards; 40 minutes waiting near a waterhole on an off-chance is not a good use of my time if I want to see a variety of animals. He ignored the request.At the end he belittled the tip I gave him.Apparently, some of the jeep drivers are ex-fishermen who can make an easier living fleecing tourists.I hope that this review helps you to plan your visits to the game reserves of Sri Lanka.

"On the south of the island, in places like Unawatuna and Hikkaduwa, lie the white sands of the Indian Ocean beaches. A far cry from the green jungles and tea plantations on the mountains. However, all you have to do is take a look around, and if the beach is quiet, it’s easy to imagine yourself as a deserted sailor from centuries ago washing onto an uninhabited island.Sitting on the shoreline, listening to the waves lap up the beach, watching the sky go from yellow, to red, to black, is an extremely relaxing way to end the day.",2018/05/10,Martin O,

"Yala is a great wildlife destination. But it is let down by the shockingly poor conditions of the roads and tracks. I've not seen a single wildlife destination in India with such bad tracks. The safari operators solve this problem through specially adapted vehicles with large tyres and high clearances. Inside the park, there is nowhere except the beach area to stop or use toilets. There are no watch towers, despite there being lovely views available.Several people have complained about safari vehicles rushing to crowd the animals when there is a sighting - this is a real concern but there are no easy solutions. Drivers are try to give their client the best sightings, and sometimes this leads to jostling for jeep positions but there is give and take, no real aggression. These guys do this everyday so obviously no one wants to be unpopular. Also, they rely on each other to pass information.Those concerned about the welfare of animals due to excessive traffic need to balance their views with the safety that Yala provides these animals. Animals have individual personalities and not all are equally bothered by jeeps and tourists.Our driver told us that there were 5-6 Asian bears in Yala, and all but one were very shy and ran away as soon as they saw a jeep. But one (the one we saw) was so casual the jeeps surrounded him and he was walking between jeeps like a cyclist meandering through London traffic, but with less aggression. The drivers knew the individual's behavior and took advantage of it for their benefit of their clients. A huge male elephant in musth also passed by within touching distance of our jeep, showing no sign of aggression or stress at our presence. Our guide knew we were safe with this elephant. The park itself is beautiful, and has the unique location along the coast. The beach is good but the sea is too rough to swim. When the jeeps stop here during the all day safari for lunch, the weather is often too hot to enjoy the beach which has no shade. It would be nice if the authorities can erect some thatched structures on the beach for people to rest and relax.",2018/05/10,worldtravelplus,"Cambridge, United Kingdom"
"Out of the two major national parks in Sri Lanka, we choose to take the safari in Yalla National Park. While we did see a lot of wildlife, we were disappointed we didn’t see more of the larger animals. We saw lots of spotted deer, a few crocodiles, and lots of wild pigs. But as for elephants we saw only two, a brief glimpse of a leopard, and no sloth bears.Of course safari is not like going to a zoo, and the animals may not be where the guides think they are as they are free to roam around. But we were still hoping to see more of the large wildlife. Our guide did explain to us that as we only did a half day safari, (which was by the way only three hours), it lessened our chances. Doing the full day safari would have increased our odds at seeing everything.Be aware it’s an early start, the road is extremely bumpy, and there are few toilet stops! You may spend more time looking for a washroom than for the elusive leopard!",2018/05/10,Martin O,
We did two drives. We saw a leopard on both occasions. There are a lot of jeeps in the park. Personally I think too many. We are a couple and had a whole jeep to ourselves. Realistically people could share. When we saw the leopard all the jeeps swarm to the same spot. Drivers rev their engines and cause a lot of noise pollution. I don’t think this is responsible tourism. We really enjoyed the experience but I think the government will need to regulate this better if they want to sustain it.,2018/05/10,Aoife B,"Dublin, Ireland"
"Biggest waste of money, for a park with large numbers of elephant we saw 5. It is too touristy and there is no respect for others as drivers fly for optimal spot blocking views for everyone else. I dont know how the jeep drivers keep their vehicles on the road as the roads are beyond a joke. Maybe try Udawalawe instead being smaller.",2018/05/10,Bigred62_50,Gold coast Australia

"We set off from our hotel in tissa at 5:30am- after reaching yala our Safari started around 6:20am. In total we payed 3500rps each for the entrance to the park and 6500rps for our private jeep (for 2) plus a 1000rps tip for our guide. Our guide Krishan was lovely and spotted many animals on our bumpy ride through the park- including crocodiles, elephants, peacocks, deer. Sadly despite his best efforts we weren’t able to spot a leopard despite there being a few leopard sightings that morning. What happens is once a leopard is spotted then all the jeeps rush to that area which ofcourse causes the leopard to flee before you get there! We tried chasing 2 separate leopards with no luck. In total we were out on safari for 4 hours and it was definitely a fun experience despite no leopard sighting. Would’ve been 5 rating if we’d seen one !",2018/05/08,ayesha c,"Manchester, United Kingdom"
"Also known as Ruhuna is an important national park on the south east coast of Sri Lanka. The reserve covers 979 km², although only the original 141 km² are open to the public. Much of the reserve is parkland, but it also contains jungle, beaches, freshwater lakes and rivers and scrubland. The latter zone is punctuated with enormous rocky outcrops. The range of habitats gives rise to a good range of wildlife.Yala has the world's highest concentration of Leopards, although seeing this largely nocturnal carnivore still requires some luck. There are good numbers of Asian Elephants, crocodile, Wild Boar, Water Buffalo and Grey langurs amongst other large animals. The open parkland attracts birds of prey such as White-bellied Sea Eagle and the wetlands have waders, Painted Storks, and the rare Black-necked Stork.Landbirds of course are in abundance, and include Sirkeer Malkoha, Indian Peafowl and Sri Lanka Jungle fowl.",2018/05/08,Ranmal F,"Moratuwa, Sri Lanka"

Otherwise the place is definitely interesting and known for hosting the tooth of Buddha in a golden box.

"I went to Sri Lanka in 2015. Sri Lanka is not a popular destination among Mexicans, but I have some very good friends there, so I decided to give it a try and it was totally worth it. I stayed with my friends in Colombo, and they helped me to arrange accommodation in Sigiriya, because it is necessary to stay there over night to visit the World Heritage Site. There are some local bed and breakfast, so it’s quite easy to find accommodation, and the people is very friendly. Maybe it has to do with Budism, but the people there is peaceful and friendly in general. I had no problems at all traveling alone to Kandi, Galle and Sigiriya. The World Heritage Site is absolutely breath taking, is a must see place, at least once in a life time. The whole tour takes like three hours, so you better wear comfortable shoes, and it’s very hot, so I recommend sport sandals. Sun screen is a must and a hat to protect your face. Water, enough water for a long walk under the sun. At some point, you will find vendors of wood handcrafts, they are really beautiful. I bought a wooden box. Not expensive at all.

"Opted for a full day safari... the experience was underwhelming to say the least. Super bumby roads make the safari quite painful - after 1h was already regretting to have opted for a full day vs half a day. The drivers, while cordial, did not speak English whatsoever so the interaction was basically zero. It felt he was driving a bit randomly here and there in search for animals. Compared to other safaris did previously the experience was really disappointing. The lack of information provided by yhe Yala National Park was also not accurate. Basically, they pick you up at 5 AM, it takes 1h to get through the park entrance (7K rupees for 2 people), and then you are on the jeep for 7 (7!) hours. Lunch break has to take place in the park (bring your own food) - meaning you cannot leave the park premise - and then back on bumpy riding for other 4/5 hours... Eventually came back to the hotel with massive headache... if you want to still do the safari after this review anyway, would highly recommend the half day version.. the full day is just way too painful",2018/05/05,Dodo1297,

Worth taking your time and working your way to the top.A word of caution - Sigriya is located in a valley so the temperature is +1 or 2 degrees Celsius hotter than elsewhere. One should also carry lots of water, slather yourself in sunscreen and even worth taking an umbrella to protect from the sun. THE most important tip i can give is when you hike up and make it to the base of Lions rock, if you're facing the staircases leading up, then at the 7 o'clock direction is a tap. Its extremely comfortable and useful to douse yourself in cold water, as you'll probably need it by now.

There'll be many guides that will approach you anyway to enquire if you're interested. i believe a price of USD15 pp is the norm, but please do your own research.Tickets can be purchased from the ticket office. It's best if you pre-book your tickets as a queue is there for purchases made on the day. Also, the ticket office is not air conditioned so it does get pretty hot.Its also worth noting that the tourist car park is not the one where you arrive at. Your driver should point it out.

"Sigiriya is absolutely amazing and well worth the hike up. We started the hike around 9.30am and made it back down by around 11.30am. We are relatively fit but not experienced hikers. It is definitely hot and sweaty but there are areas where you can a rest in the shade. Also, mid way through the hike, there are handrails to hold onto. We would recommend trainers, hat and some water. We also took a small face towel to mop up the sweat and to wet our faces. If you see large crowds of school children - we would recommend waiting for them to pass the last leg e.g. from the lions claws onwards. There are a few huge wasp nests there and if there is a lot of noise - the wasps will attack. There is a safety cage at the lions claws if there is an attack but no safety cage once you start climbing.We had a tour guide (which cost USD 15) and we found it really useful. He explained a lot of things that we would have missed, and the ingenuity of the site. Also, he could point out where the wasps nests were (there are a few). For example, during part of the hike, the wasps starting swarming and ushered us to move faster and keep low just in case they attacked.I would definitely recommend visiting the site and the hike is do-able - just take it slow and head up as early as you can. Note that there are no toilets after the ticket area so make sure you are prepared.",2018/05/04,Lianna C,

Unlike other temples I've been to - this temple has something quite special. It's not swarming with tourists and actually full of locals who come to the temple to pray or provide offerings. It was a really nice experience - it's not full of tourists taking photos but an active religious area and felt extremely peaceful despite it being in the middle of the city centre. We didn't spend too long there but you could easily spend hours walking in and out of the different buildings.

This problem has worsened over the years and is a serious threat to the animals and their habitat. Although we did see some of Sri Lanka’s most treasured fauna and flora in the park, the behavior of the guides and some of the visitors (littering in the park, shouting), has persuaded us not to return.

"This temple is in the centre of Kandy near the lake. It houses a Buddhist relic, Buddha's tooth.The building is lovely and, while I'm not Buddhist, it was amazing to see people praying to it. You dont actually see into where the relic is. A man outside told us it is open during ceremony times (in the morning and 6.30pm at night) but we didn't verify that.It's a temple so you have to cover your shoulders and knees. If you get stuck then there are stalls selling cheap sarongs in the square outside. Also you can't wear shoes and you need to leave them at a stall for a small fee.The entrance fee was a little bit steep by Sri Lankan standards (1500 rupees) but still not too expensive by western standards.",2018/05/03,Wellingt0n_Traveller,"London, United Kingdom"

"I have heard of this 1600-year-old place from a friend and in spite of a crowded day to visit this place due to a nationwide holiday (Vesak Festival), it was all worth it. Our tour driver Muhamed was able to contact a tour guide to assist us in climbing the Fortress and this guide Ranji was able to lead us to a faster path to the top while telling us the story behind it, overtaking most of the crowd. We were able to do complete a round trip in 2 hours.The ticket costs 30 USD. We climbed the rock after we did the hot air balloon activity during sunrise. Yes, it was indeed hot but we were overwhelmed by the structure and the history behind it.One should really visit this place to get an idea and feel of what the old kingdom had in 5th century AD.Not for the faint-hearted as the climb is steep and high from the ground. Since it was crowded during our time, the queue served as breaks from the climb so we didn't feel so tired except for the scorching heat of the sun. Make sure to bring water and wear a hat. Probably sunrise would be the best time. The view from the top is breathtaking as well as the 'floor plan' on top of the massive rock. Imagine a civilization 1600 years ago. Whew. Amazing planning and irrigation system. I would also recommend a guide to tell you the different parts of the 'city' and the story behind it. Our guide speaks English and understandable.",2018/05/02,elyt_filler,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"
"One of Singapore guy joined a full day safari game in tissa on 27 March but he didn't see any leopards even they knew the leopard was here because too many jeeps. Fortunately, I joined a camping with their safari team in Kataragama on 28 March. Easily see leopards, 4 leopards within 2 games. Amazing!How to increase your chance to see leopard1. Select weekday2. Kataragama gate as less tourist. Enjoyable!3. Professional safari team (read reliable comments) it is the most important. Then, u have a higher chance even too many jeeps4. Safari in morning or afternoon5. Stay one night moreThose are my experience and come from review of many comments.",2018/05/02,crystal c,Hong Kong
"Compact and easy to navigate, lots of great locations for pictures. Historical and lots of nooks and crannies to explore.

Make sure you...More",2018/05/02,MJGUK,"Solihull, United Kingdom"
We decided to go for a walk around when we arrived to get our bearings. It is a lovely place and we plan to go for a run tomorrow morning.,2018/05/02,kirstymay123,"Aberdeen, United Kingdom"
"Marissa is one of the most beautiful beaches we have ever seen.  The setting seems perfect. There are some resorts, but nothing too grande. 
If you're lucky you can see turtles hatching or laying eggs at night.",2018/05/02,Dominiquevanloo,
Beautiful - the whole ceremony involved - however the queues were long but well worth the trouble. Kandy is very serene,2018/05/02,julesOnTour,"Llanelli, United Kingdom"
"I would recommend a guide so you can see everything there is to offer and understand it all. Do it at night, 6.30 it begins but get there early. A lot of people, but no one is rude and everything runs smoothly. If you don’t get a guide then you’d need to know a lot about Buddhism",2018/05/02,beefaman,"Mermaid Beach, Australia"
"You will be disappointed if you think you can see the Tooth as you can’t. We weren’t even sure where it was or had we missed it and had to ask. Temple is impressive and enjoyed reading the history of the Tooth and walking round the gardens. Tip do not stand in front of artefacts if taking photos it’s disrespectful. You have to remove your shoes so take some socks unless your happy bear feet. Combine with a walk round the lake,a must visit whilst in Kandy and was pleased to emerse myself in this fascinating religion.",2018/05/02,MJGUK,"Solihull, United Kingdom"
